## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the railroad tracks, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces.

   - **Key Terrain:** The road junction at OBJ HERRERA (MP 0585 1552) controls north-south movement through AO COTTO. Woodlines on the east and west sides of the approach route provide covered and concealed avenues of approach. A small rise north of the objective offers observation and fields of fire over the junction.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during storms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
A squad-sized REAPER element occupies hasty fighting positions in the vicinity of OBJ HERRERA. They are equipped with small arms and are using the road junction to control local movement.

**1. Composition.** 4-6 REAPER personnel with small arms in hasty fighting positions.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces occupy positions oriented south along the road junction at MP 0585 1552. They have limited observation to the east and west due to vegetation.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER defends from current positions, returns fire when engaged, and attempts to withdraw north if overwhelmed.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has reinforcements nearby and counterattacks from the north after friendly forces commit to the assault.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company attacks to seize key terrain in AO COTTO to deny REAPER freedom of movement.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Seize OBJ HERRERA to deny REAPER use of the road junction and establish conditions for follow-on operations.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians may be present in the area. Avoid civilian casualties and collateral damage.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## Step 1: Receive the Mission

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 1: Receive the Mission," HOPE-W, 1/3-2/3 Rule*

When you receive this order, you need to immediately begin extracting critical information. You are not just listening — you are analyzing. Here is what you should capture:

**Extract the mission statement (the 5 W's):**

| W | Answer from this OPORD |
|---|------------------------|
| **WHO** | 1st Platoon, A Co. 4th BN-211th INF |
| **WHAT** | Attacks to seize OBJ HERRERA |
| **WHEN** | NLT ____ (to be filled in at briefing) |
| **WHERE** | MP 0585 1552, AO COTTO |
| **WHY** | To deny REAPER use of the road junction and enable follow-on operations |

**Understand higher's mission and intent:**
- A Company's mission: Attack to seize key terrain in AO COTTO to deny REAPER freedom of movement.
- Commander's intent: Seize OBJ HERRERA to deny REAPER use of the road junction and establish conditions for follow-on operations.

**Conduct initial time analysis (HOPE-W):**
- **H** — Higher: What is A Company's timeline? When is H-hour?
- **O** — Operational: How long will movement, actions on objective, and consolidation take?
- **P** — Planning & Preparation: When do I issue my WARNORD? When do I issue my OPORD? When are rehearsals and PCC/PCI?
- **E** — Enemy: Does the enemy have a timeline that affects us? Can they reinforce?
- **W** — Weather: Light data — when is BMNT, sunrise, sunset, EENT?

**Apply the 1/3-2/3 Rule:** If you have 75 minutes to plan, you use no more than 25 minutes for your own analysis before issuing your WARNORD. Your squads get the remaining 50 minutes to prepare.

---

## Step 2: Issue a Warning Order

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 2: Issue Warning Order," Gen Mattis quote: "What do I know? Who needs to know? Have I told them?"*

Issue your WARNORD immediately after initial analysis. Do not wait until you have a complete plan. Your subordinates need time to prepare.

**Minimum WARNORD content from this OPORD:**

1. **Type of operation:** Deliberate attack
2. **General location:** OBJ HERRERA, vic MP 0585 1552, AO COTTO
3. **Initial timeline:** SP time, H-hour (fill in when given time hack)
4. **Reconnaissance to initiate:** PL will conduct leader's recon from the ORP
5. **Movement to initiate:** Begin movement to assembly area
6. **Preparation instructions:** Draw ammunition, conduct PCC/PCI, prepare for dismounted movement

---

## Step 3: Make a Tentative Plan

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Detailed METT-TC Analysis," OAKOC, Enemy Analysis, AGADAP, SAFDC*

This is the longest step. You conduct a detailed METT-TC analysis and develop your course of action using AGADAP.

### METT-TC Analysis Applied to This OPORD

**M — Mission:**
- **Specified tasks:** Attack to seize OBJ HERRERA; deny REAPER use of road junction; report to higher upon consolidation.
- **Implied tasks:** Establish ORP; conduct leader's recon; establish support by fire; consolidate and reorganize on the objective; treat and evacuate casualties.
- **Essential task:** Seize OBJ HERRERA — this goes into your mission statement.

**E — Enemy:**
- Composition: 4-6 personnel, small arms, hasty fighting positions.
- Disposition: Oriented south along road junction at MP 0585 1552; limited observation east/west.
- MPCOA: Defend, return fire, withdraw north if overwhelmed.
- MDCOA: Reinforcements counterattack from the north.
- *Ask yourself:* How does the enemy's orientation affect my scheme of maneuver? Where are his blind spots?

**T — Terrain and Weather (OAKOC):**
- **O** — Observation and Fields of Fire: Enemy has fields of fire to the south along the road. Rise north of OBJ offers observation. Woodlines limit long-range observation east/west.
- **A** — Avenues of Approach: Road from south (enemy oriented this way — avoid). Woodline from the east (concealed approach for assault). Rise from the north (good SBF position).
- **K** — Key Terrain: The road junction at OBJ HERRERA — whoever controls it controls movement. The rise north of OBJ is key for support by fire.
- **O** — Obstacles: Dense underbrush may slow movement. Wetlands restrict vehicle movement.
- **C** — Cover and Concealment: Woodlines east and west provide concealment for approach. Hasty fighting positions provide cover for enemy.

**T — Troops Available:**
- 3 rifle squads, PL, PSG. No attachments. Standard infantry platoon weapons.

**T — Time Available:**
- Apply backwards planning from H-hour. Account for movement, ORP establishment, leader's recon, issuance of order, rehearsals, and PCC/PCI.

**C — Civil Considerations:**
- Civilians may be present. ROE requires PID before engagement. Avoid collateral damage.

### COA Development (AGADAP)

**A — Analyze Relative Combat Power:**
- Friendly: 3 squads (~27 personnel), small arms, automatic weapons. Advantage in numbers (roughly 5:1).
- Enemy: 4-6 personnel, small arms, hasty positions. Advantage in prepared defense and knowledge of terrain.
- *Exploit:* Numerical superiority, enemy blind spots to the east. *Mitigate:* Enemy prepared positions by suppressing with SBF.

**G — Generate Options:**
- The enemy is oriented south with limited observation east/west. A flank attack from the east using the woodline for concealment is the most suitable form of maneuver.

**A — Array Forces:**
- Decisive operation: 2nd Squad (assault from the east)
- Shaping operation: 1st Squad (SBF from the rise)
- Reserve/security: 3rd Squad (ORP security, reserve)

**D — Develop Concept of Operations:**
- Movement from assembly area to ORP. Leader's recon confirms enemy positions. 1st Squad moves to SBF position. On signal, 1st Squad suppresses. 2nd Squad assaults through from the east. 3rd Squad secures ORP and is prepared to reinforce. Consolidate on objective.

**A — Assign Responsibilities:**
- 1st SL: SBF element — suppress enemy positions on signal
- 2nd SL: Assault element — assault through OBJ from east
- 3rd SL: ORP security and reserve — reinforce on order
- PSG: Consolidation, casualty collection, resupply coordination

**P — Prepare COA Statement:**
> "The purpose of this operation is to deny REAPER use of the road junction at OBJ HERRERA. Decisive to this operation is 2nd Squad's assault through OBJ HERRERA from the east. This is decisive because it destroys the enemy force on the objective and seizes the key terrain. We will accomplish this by conducting a flank attack. We will assume risk by committing 3rd Squad to ORP security rather than the assault. We will mitigate this risk by suppressing the enemy with 1st Squad's support by fire before the assault begins."

### COA Screening (SAFDC)

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **S** — Suitable | Yes — seizes OBJ, denies road junction to REAPER |
| **A** — Acceptable | Yes — numerical advantage minimizes friendly risk |
| **F** — Feasible | Yes — within platoon capabilities, terrain supports the plan |
| **D** — Distinguishable | N/A — single COA for this exercise |
| **C** — Complete | Yes — addresses who, what, when, where, why |

---

## Step 4: Initiate Movement

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Steps 4-6 are Interchangeable"*

While you complete planning, your subordinates should already be preparing based on your WARNORD. Movement tasks at this step may include:

- Squads conduct initial weapons and equipment checks
- PSG coordinates ammunition and water distribution
- Squads rehearse battle drills (react to contact, break contact)
- Element begins movement toward the assembly area or line of departure

**Key point:** Steps 4, 5, and 6 are interchangeable. You may initiate movement before completing your recon or finishing the plan. Do not wait until everything is perfect — time is your most valuable resource.

---

## Step 5: Conduct Reconnaissance

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 5: Conduct Reconnaissance," GOTWA*

Before leaving for leader's recon, issue a **GOTWA** briefing to your PSG:

| Letter | This Mission |
|--------|-------------|
| **G** — Going | To the high ground IVO MP 0610 1550 and the woodline east of OBJ HERRERA |
| **O** — Others | RTO and 1st Squad Leader |
| **T** — Time | Return NLT ____ (set a specific time) |
| **W** — What if | If I don't return by ____, PSG assumes command and executes the plan as briefed |
| **A** — Actions on contact | Break contact, return to ORP, report |

**During recon, confirm or deny your assumptions:**
- Is the enemy where the OPORD says they are? (Vicinity MP 0585 1552)
- Are fighting positions oriented south as expected?
- Does the woodline to the east actually provide a concealed approach?
- Is the rise north of the objective suitable for a SBF position?
- Are there obstacles or terrain features not shown on the map?

**If recon changes the situation, modify your plan.** This is what makes TLPs a dynamic process, not a checklist.

---

## Step 6: Complete the Plan

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 6: Complete the Plan," Terrain Model Checklist*

Update your tentative plan based on what you found on recon. Prepare your briefing aids.

**Build your terrain model. Required elements:**

- North seeking arrow
- Scale (1 pace = X meters)
- Current location / Assembly Area
- ORP location (vic MP 0607 1555)
- OBJ HERRERA with grid (MP 0585 1552)
- Enemy positions (oriented south at the junction)
- Phase lines (if used)
- Primary and alternate routes
- SBF position (rise at MP 0610 1550)
- Assault route (woodline from the east)
- Danger areas
- Rally points

**Finalize your OPORD.** Fill in the details from your recon: exact positions, adjusted routes, specific coordination measures, and updated timeline.

---

## Step 7: Issue the Order

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 7: Issue the Order," 5-Paragraph OPORD Format, Coordinating Instructions Checklist*

Deliver your 5-paragraph order to your squad leaders using your terrain model. This is where the OPORD format you just studied becomes the framework for your briefing.

**Brief in order: Situation, Mission, Execution, Sustainment, Command and Signal.**

**Common failures at this step** (from the TLP slides):
- Reading verbatim instead of briefing from knowledge of the plan
- Speaking too quietly — project your voice
- Not using the terrain model — point to locations as you brief them
- Unable to answer questions about the plan
- No confirmation brief — always have subordinates brief back their understanding
- Poor command presence — deliver with confidence and authority

**After issuing the order, conduct a confirmation brief:**
- Have each squad leader brief back their task and purpose
- Verify they understand the concept of the operation and the decisive point
- Confirm they know the timeline, signals, and contingencies

---

## Step 8: Supervise and Refine

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 8: Supervise & Refine," Rehearsal Types, PCC/PCI*

This step is continuous — it happens throughout and after all other steps.

**Conduct rehearsals.** Even a short rock drill on the terrain model is valuable:
- Walk through the scheme of maneuver on the terrain model
- Each squad leader traces their element's movement and actions
- Identify the signal to initiate the SBF and the signal to lift/shift fires
- Walk through actions on the objective and consolidation

**Conduct PCC/PCI (Pre-Combat Checks / Pre-Combat Inspections):**
- Weapons, ammunition, water, equipment
- Communications check (radios, batteries)
- **Most important:** Verify every Soldier understands the mission and their specific role

**Continue to refine.** As the situation develops, adjust the plan. If the enemy moves, if weather changes, if you lose a key leader — adapt. TLPs are a dynamic process, not a one-time event.

---

> **INSTRUCTOR WRAP-UP**
>
> The 8 TLP steps applied to this OPORD demonstrate the complete planning process from receiving the mission to crossing the line of departure. Key takeaways for candidates:
>
> 1. **The order gives you information — TLPs tell you what to do with it.** Every paragraph of the OPORD feeds specific TLP steps.
> 2. **Time management is critical.** The 1/3-2/3 rule is not a suggestion. Issue your WARNORD early.
> 3. **Steps 1-3 are sequential; Steps 4-6 are interchangeable.** Do not wait for a perfect plan before initiating movement or reconnaissance.
> 4. **The terrain model is your primary briefing tool.** Build it during planning and use it to deliver your order.
> 5. **Common failures are in Steps 3 and 7** — analysis and order delivery. Master METT-TC analysis and practice briefing with confidence.
