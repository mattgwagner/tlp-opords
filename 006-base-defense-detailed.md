## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. FOB THUNDER is located at MP 0610 1550 within the MOUT training area (AO HERRERA), surrounded by urban terrain and limited open areas.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** FOB THUNDER is situated in an urban environment with multiple buildings, narrow streets, and limited open spaces. The surrounding area includes adjacent buildings, alleys, and potential enemy approach routes. Urban terrain provides numerous positions for both defense and enemy infiltration. Buildings offer observation points and fields of fire, while underground routes and alleys may be used by enemy forces. Limited vehicle access due to urban constraints.

   - **Key Terrain:** FOB THUNDER itself is the decisive terrain. Adjacent buildings and intersections provide observation and fields of fire for defensive positions. Main roads and alleys are likely avenues of approach for enemy forces. High ground (rooftops) offers observation advantages.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are an irregular force capable of conducting reconnaissance, infiltration, and attacks against friendly positions. They are experienced in urban operations and may employ small arms, IEDs, and indirect fire. They are capable of blending with the local populace and using urban terrain for concealment and approach.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 6-10 REAPER personnel, small arms, possible RPG/HMG, IEDs, and communications equipment.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are likely operating in the surrounding urban area, conducting reconnaissance and seeking opportunities to infiltrate or attack the FOB. They may establish observation posts or use civilians to gather intelligence. Exact locations unknown.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces conduct reconnaissance of the FOB perimeter, attempt limited infiltration or probing attacks, and may employ indirect fire or IEDs to harass friendly forces. They avoid decisive engagement but seek to gather intelligence and disrupt operations.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces launch a coordinated attack with multiple elements, using infiltration, indirect fire, and IEDs to breach the perimeter and attack critical assets. REAPER forces attempt to overrun defensive positions or cause significant casualties before withdrawing.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company establishes and maintains security of FOB THUNDER to protect critical assets and enable continued operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Maintain a secure perimeter, prevent enemy infiltration, and protect critical assets to ensure FOB THUNDER remains operational and secure.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians are present in the surrounding urban area. Defensive operations must minimize risk to non-combatants, avoid collateral damage, and maintain positive relations with local populace while ensuring base security.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon establishes and maintains defensive positions around FOB THUNDER (MP 0610 1550) NLT ____ to prevent REAPER infiltration, protect critical assets, and maintain security of the forward operating base.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Protect critical assets at FOB THUNDER and deny REAPER the ability to disrupt operations in AO HERRERA.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Establish a secure defensive perimeter around FOB THUNDER. (2) Maintain early warning and security patrol coverage. (3) Retain the ability to reinforce any threatened sector.

**End State:** FOB THUNDER has a secure perimeter, REAPER infiltration is prevented, critical assets are protected, and the FOB remains operational.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon establishes a perimeter defense of FOB THUNDER. Two squads occupy defensive sectors covering the primary avenues of approach, with fighting positions, observation posts, and assigned sectors of fire providing interlocking coverage. A reserve element provides observation of secondary approaches and serves as the QRF to reinforce any threatened sector. The platoon conducts security patrols to extend early warning beyond the perimeter. The defense is organized to defeat REAPER reconnaissance, infiltration, and direct assault in that priority.

### c. Scheme of Fires
Defensive fires planned for likely enemy avenues of approach. 1st Squad, covering the most likely avenue of approach, has priority of indirect fires. Indirect fire support available on request. Fires coordinated to avoid fratricide and minimize collateral damage.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Northern Sector):**

- **TASK:** Occupy and defend the northern sector of FOB THUNDER (MP 0610 1550). Establish fighting positions with interlocking fields of fire covering the northern approach routes and adjacent buildings. Establish OPs at key locations to provide early warning. Conduct security patrols north of the perimeter as directed by the PL.
- **PURPOSE:** Defeat REAPER infiltration or assault from the north — the most likely avenue of approach — and provide the earliest possible warning of enemy activity.

**2. 2nd Squad (Southern Sector):**

- **TASK:** Occupy and defend the southern sector of FOB THUNDER. Establish fighting positions with interlocking fields of fire covering the southern approach routes and adjacent buildings. Establish OPs covering the southern avenues of approach. Conduct security patrols south of the perimeter as directed.
- **PURPOSE:** Prevent REAPER from bypassing the northern defenses and attacking from the south, ensuring the perimeter has no undefended approach.

**3. 3rd Squad (Reserve / QRF):**

- **TASK:** Maintain observation of the eastern and western approaches from positions within the FOB. Serve as the platoon QRF, prepared to reinforce 1st or 2nd Squad's sector within 5 minutes of contact. Conduct rehearsals for reinforcement of each sector. Be prepared to man a supplementary position on the eastern or western perimeter on order.
- **PURPOSE:** Provide the PL flexibility to mass combat power at any threatened point without pulling defenders from their primary sectors.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only confirmed enemy combatants posing a threat.
   2. Use graduated response appropriate to the threat.

   1. Penetration or breach of the perimeter at any point
   2. Indirect fire impacting the FOB or adjacent areas
   3. Loss of any LP/OP or degradation of early warning capability
   4. Friendly casualties degrading ability to man all defensive sectors
   5. Unusual civilian activity near the perimeter suggesting imminent attack (massing, sudden departure from area)

**4. Reporting:**
   - **Report to higher when assuming defensive positions.**
   - **In Position Report:** Upon occupying defensive positions.
   - **SALUTE Report:** Upon sighting enemy forces or indicators.
