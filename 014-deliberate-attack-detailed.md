## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the old railroad bed, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The AO consists of flat terrain with sandy soils and dense pine and hardwood forests throughout. Thick vegetation and tree canopy severely limit observation and fields of fire except along improved roads and clearings. Jacksonville Street runs east-west through the northern portion of the AO. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south, intersecting Jacksonville Street at the objective. These improved roads are the primary avenues of approach and the only locations offering extended fields of fire. The woods between and surrounding the roads provide excellent concealment for dismounted movement but restrict visibility to under 50 meters in most areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The road junction of Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue at OBJ HERRERA (MP 0602 1565) controls north-south and east-west movement through AO COTTO. The woodlines surrounding the junction on all sides provide covered and concealed avenues of approach for dismounted elements. Bradenton Avenue south of the junction provides a cleared lane of fire into the objective from the south.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during storms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
A squad-sized REAPER element occupies hasty fighting positions in the vicinity of OBJ HERRERA on the north side of Jacksonville Street, north of the junction with Bradenton Avenue. They are equipped with small arms and are using the road junction to control local movement.

**1. Composition.** 4-6 REAPER personnel with small arms in hasty fighting positions.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces occupy positions oriented south and southwest along the Bradenton Avenue corridor and the Jacksonville Street junction at MP 0602 1565. Dense woods to the north provide them cover from that direction. They have limited observation to the east and west due to thick vegetation but can observe south along Bradenton Avenue and east-west along Jacksonville Street.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER defends from current positions, returns fire when engaged, and attempts to withdraw north into the dense woods or east along Jacksonville Street if overwhelmed.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has reinforcements nearby at a position further north and counterattacks from the north through the woodline after friendly forces commit to the assault.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company attacks to seize key terrain in AO COTTO to deny REAPER freedom of movement.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Seize OBJ HERRERA to deny REAPER use of the road junction and establish conditions for follow-on operations.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians may be present in the area. Avoid civilian casualties and collateral damage.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

---

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon attacks to seize OBJ HERRERA (MP 0602 1565) NLT ____ in order to deny REAPER use of the road junction and enable follow-on operations in AO COTTO.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Deny REAPER control of the key road junction at OBJ HERRERA to enable friendly freedom of movement through AO COTTO.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Seize OBJ HERRERA. (2) Destroy or displace REAPER forces at the junction. (3) Consolidate on the objective and prepare for follow-on operations.

**End State:** OBJ HERRERA seized, REAPER forces destroyed or displaced, platoon consolidated on the objective with a hasty perimeter oriented north and east.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a deliberate attack to seize OBJ HERRERA. The platoon establishes an ORP in the woodline west of Bradenton Avenue, and the PL conducts a leader's reconnaissance. The support element, as the shaping operation, fixes the enemy from the south along the Bradenton Avenue corridor. The assault element, as the main effort, maneuvers through the concealed woodline and attacks the objective from the west — exploiting the enemy's limited observation off the improved roads. The reserve provides ORP security and is prepared to reinforce on order. Upon seizure, the platoon consolidates and reports.

### c. Scheme of Fires
2nd Squad, as the decisive effort, has priority of indirect fires. Mortar support is available through company on request.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Support by Fire — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** From the ORP (MP 0586 1552), move east through the woodline to a support-by-fire position on Bradenton Avenue south of OBJ HERRERA (IVO MP 0601 1552), oriented north. On the PL's signal, initiate suppressive fire north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor into REAPER positions at the junction. Shift or cease fires on order as 2nd Squad enters the objective.
- **PURPOSE:** Fix REAPER in their fighting positions so 2nd Squad can close on and assault through the objective without receiving aimed fire from the south-facing positions.

**2. 2nd Squad (Assault — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** From the ORP, move north through the woodline to an assault position west of OBJ HERRERA. On order, assault east through the objective, crossing Jacksonville Street and clearing through REAPER positions on the north side of the junction (MP 0602 1565). Destroy REAPER forces and seize the road junction. Signal "objective secured" upon completion.
- **PURPOSE:** Destroy the enemy force on the objective and seize the key terrain that controls movement through AO COTTO.

**3. 3rd Squad (Security / Reserve):**

- **TASK:** Secure the ORP (MP 0586 1552) and provide rear security during the assault. Be prepared to reinforce 1st or 2nd Squad on order, or establish a blocking position north of the objective to prevent REAPER reinforcement from the woodline.
- **PURPOSE:** Provide the PL a reserve to exploit success or respond to REAPER counterattack without pulling the SBF or assault element off task.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only confirmed enemy combatants.
   2. Use minimum force necessary to accomplish the mission.
   3. Avoid civilian casualties and collateral damage.
   4. Positively identify targets before firing.

**2. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR):**
   1. Confirm REAPER positions and strength at OBJ HERRERA, specifically their orientation along Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue.
   2. Identify any REAPER reinforcement routes from the north through the woodline or along Avenue C.
   3. Assess civilian presence in the area, particularly along Jacksonville Street and in the vicinity of structures east of the objective.

**3. Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR):**
   1. Enemy strength or disposition at OBJ HERRERA significantly different from the intelligence estimate
   2. Loss of the support-by-fire position or inability to achieve fire superiority
   3. REAPER reinforcements approaching from the north along Avenue C or through the woodline
   4. Friendly casualty in the assault element requiring immediate MEDEVAC
   5. Civilian presence on or near the objective preventing planned fires

# PRACTICAL EXERCISE: APPLYING TLPs TO THIS ORDER

> **INSTRUCTOR GUIDE**
>
> The following section walks through each of the 8 Troop Leading Procedure steps as applied to the OPORD above. Use this during the crawl-phase class to demonstrate what a candidate should do at each step when they receive an order. Pause at each step for discussion and questions.
>
> **Reference:** [TLP Instructional Slides](POI/Slides-RevealJS.html)

## Step 1: Receive the Mission

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 1: Receive the Mission," HOPE-W, 1/3-2/3 Rule*

When you receive this order, you need to immediately begin extracting critical information. You are not just listening — you are analyzing. Here is what you should capture:

**Extract the mission statement (the 5 W's):**

| W | Answer from this OPORD |
|---|------------------------|
| **WHO** | 1st Platoon, A Co. 4th BN-211th INF |
| **WHAT** | Attacks to seize OBJ HERRERA |
| **WHEN** | NLT ____ (to be filled in at briefing) |
| **WHERE** | MP 0602 1565, AO COTTO |
| **WHY** | To deny REAPER use of the road junction and enable follow-on operations |

**Understand higher's mission and intent:**
- A Company's mission: Attack to seize key terrain in AO COTTO to deny REAPER freedom of movement.
- Commander's intent: Seize OBJ HERRERA to deny REAPER use of the road junction and establish conditions for follow-on operations.

**Conduct initial time analysis (HOPE-W):**
- **H** — Higher: What is A Company's timeline? When is H-hour?
- **O** — Operational: How long will movement, actions on objective, and consolidation take?
- **P** — Planning & Preparation: When do I issue my WARNORD? When do I issue my OPORD? When are rehearsals and PCC/PCI?
- **E** — Enemy: Does the enemy have a timeline that affects us? Can they reinforce?
- **W** — Weather: Light data — when is BMNT, sunrise, sunset, EENT?

**Apply the 1/3-2/3 Rule:** If you have 75 minutes to plan, you use no more than 25 minutes for your own analysis before issuing your WARNORD. Your squads get the remaining 50 minutes to prepare.

---

## Step 2: Issue a Warning Order

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 2: Issue Warning Order," Gen Mattis quote: "What do I know? Who needs to know? Have I told them?"*

Issue your WARNORD immediately after initial analysis. Do not wait until you have a complete plan. Your subordinates need time to prepare.

**Minimum WARNORD content from this OPORD:**

1. **Type of operation:** Deliberate attack
2. **General location:** OBJ HERRERA, vic MP 0602 1565, AO COTTO
3. **Initial timeline:** SP time, H-hour (fill in when given time hack)
4. **Reconnaissance to initiate:** PL will conduct leader's recon from the ORP
5. **Movement to initiate:** Begin movement to assembly area
6. **Preparation instructions:** Draw ammunition, conduct PCC/PCI, prepare for dismounted movement

---

## Step 3: Make a Tentative Plan

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Detailed METT-TC Analysis," OAKOC, Enemy Analysis, AGADAP, SAFDC*

This is the longest step. You conduct a detailed METT-TC analysis and develop your course of action using AGADAP.

### METT-TC Analysis Applied to This OPORD

**M — Mission:**
- **Specified tasks:** Attack to seize OBJ HERRERA; deny REAPER use of road junction; report to higher upon consolidation.
- **Implied tasks:** Establish ORP; conduct leader's recon; establish support by fire; consolidate and reorganize on the objective; treat and evacuate casualties.
- **Essential task:** Seize OBJ HERRERA — this goes into your mission statement.

**E — Enemy:**
- Composition: 4-6 personnel, small arms, hasty fighting positions.
- Disposition: North side of Jacksonville St at the Bradenton Ave junction (MP 0602 1565). Oriented south and southwest; can observe along Bradenton Ave and Jacksonville St but has limited observation into the woodlines on all sides.
- MPCOA: Defend, return fire, withdraw north into the woods or east along Jacksonville St if overwhelmed.
- MDCOA: Reinforcements counterattack from the north through the woodline.
- *Ask yourself:* How does the enemy's orientation affect my scheme of maneuver? Where are his blind spots? The enemy can see down the roads but NOT into the dense woods — exploit this.

**T — Terrain and Weather (OAKOC):**
- **O** — Observation and Fields of Fire: Enemy has fields of fire south along Bradenton Avenue and east-west along Jacksonville Street. Dense woods throughout the AO limit observation to under 50 meters off the improved roads. Bradenton Avenue south of the junction provides a cleared lane of fire for the SBF.
- **A** — Avenues of Approach: Bradenton Avenue from the south (enemy oriented this way — use for SBF, not assault). Woodlines west of Bradenton Ave provide a concealed dismounted avenue of approach for the assault element. Jacksonville Street from the east is observable by the enemy — avoid.
- **K** — Key Terrain: The road junction of Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue at OBJ HERRERA — whoever controls it controls movement through AO COTTO.
- **O** — Obstacles: Dense underbrush and pine forest slow dismounted movement off improved roads. Low-lying areas may restrict movement after rain.
- **C** — Cover and Concealment: Dense woods on all sides of the junction provide excellent concealment for approach from any direction off the roads. Hasty fighting positions provide cover for enemy. No significant elevation changes — terrain is flat throughout.

**T — Troops Available:**
- 3 rifle squads, PL, PSG. No attachments. Standard infantry platoon weapons.

**T — Time Available:**
- Apply backwards planning from H-hour. Account for movement, ORP establishment, leader's recon, issuance of order, rehearsals, and PCC/PCI.

**C — Civil Considerations:**
- Civilians may be present. ROE requires PID before engagement. Avoid collateral damage.

### COA Development (AGADAP)

**A — Analyze Relative Combat Power:**
- Friendly: 3 squads (~27 personnel), small arms, automatic weapons. Advantage in numbers (roughly 5:1).
- Enemy: 4-6 personnel, small arms, hasty positions. Advantage in prepared defense and knowledge of terrain.
- *Exploit:* Numerical superiority, enemy blind spots into the woodlines — particularly to the west. *Mitigate:* Enemy prepared positions by suppressing with SBF from the south along Bradenton Ave.

**G — Generate Options:**
- The enemy is oriented south along Bradenton Ave and east-west along Jacksonville St, with limited observation into the woodlines. A flank attack from the west using the dense woods for concealment is the most suitable form of maneuver, with a support-by-fire position south on Bradenton Ave to fix the enemy in place.

**A — Array Forces:**
- Decisive operation: 2nd Squad (assault from the west through the woodline)
- Shaping operation: 1st Squad (SBF south of OBJ on Bradenton Ave)
- Reserve/security: 3rd Squad (ORP security, reserve)

**D — Develop Concept of Operations:**
- Movement from assembly area to ORP (MP 0586 1552) in the woodline west of Bradenton Ave. Leader's recon confirms enemy positions at the junction. 1st Squad moves east to SBF position on Bradenton Ave (MP 0601 1552). 2nd Squad moves north through the woods to an assault position west of OBJ. On signal, 1st Squad suppresses north along Bradenton Ave. On order, 2nd Squad assaults east through OBJ. 3rd Squad secures ORP and is prepared to reinforce. Consolidate on objective.

**A — Assign Responsibilities:**
- 1st SL: SBF element — move east to Bradenton Ave, suppress enemy positions north on signal
- 2nd SL: Assault element — move north through woodline, assault east through OBJ on order
- 3rd SL: ORP security and reserve — reinforce on order
- PSG: Consolidation, casualty collection, resupply coordination

**P — Prepare COA Statement:**
> "The purpose of this operation is to deny REAPER use of the road junction at OBJ HERRERA. Decisive to this operation is 2nd Squad's assault through OBJ HERRERA from the west. This is decisive because it destroys the enemy force on the objective and seizes the key terrain. We will accomplish this by conducting a flank attack — SBF fixes the enemy from the south along Bradenton Avenue while the assault element maneuvers through the woods and strikes from the west, exploiting the enemy's limited observation into the woodlines. We will assume risk by committing 3rd Squad to ORP security rather than the assault. We will mitigate this risk by suppressing the enemy with 1st Squad's support by fire before the assault begins."

### COA Screening (SAFDC)

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **S** — Suitable | Yes — seizes OBJ, denies road junction to REAPER |
| **A** — Acceptable | Yes — numerical advantage minimizes friendly risk |
| **F** — Feasible | Yes — within platoon capabilities, terrain supports the plan |
| **D** — Distinguishable | N/A — single COA for this exercise |
| **C** — Complete | Yes — addresses who, what, when, where, why |

---

## Step 4: Initiate Movement

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Steps 4-6 are Interchangeable"*

While you complete planning, your subordinates should already be preparing based on your WARNORD. Movement tasks at this step may include:

- Squads conduct initial weapons and equipment checks
- PSG coordinates ammunition and water distribution
- Squads rehearse battle drills (react to contact, break contact)
- Element begins movement toward the assembly area or line of departure

**Key point:** Steps 4, 5, and 6 are interchangeable. You may initiate movement before completing your recon or finishing the plan. Do not wait until everything is perfect — time is your most valuable resource.

---

## Step 5: Conduct Reconnaissance

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 5: Conduct Reconnaissance," GOTWA*

Before leaving for leader's recon, issue a **GOTWA** briefing to your PSG:

| Letter | This Mission |
|--------|-------------|
| **G** — Going | To the woodline edge along Bradenton Avenue IVO MP 0601 1552 and the woodline west of OBJ HERRERA to confirm SBF position and assault route |
| **O** — Others | RTO and 1st Squad Leader |
| **T** — Time | Return NLT ____ (set a specific time) |
| **W** — What if | If I don't return by ____, PSG assumes command and executes the plan as briefed |
| **A** — Actions on contact | Break contact, return to ORP, report |

**During recon, confirm or deny your assumptions:**
- Is the enemy where the OPORD says they are? (North side of Jacksonville St at the Bradenton Ave junction, vic MP 0602 1565)
- Are fighting positions oriented south along Bradenton Ave and along Jacksonville St as expected?
- Does Bradenton Avenue south of the junction provide a clear lane of fire for the SBF?
- Does the woodline west of the objective actually provide a concealed approach for the assault element moving north from the ORP?
- Are there obstacles, structures, or terrain features not shown on the map — particularly between the ORP and the objective?

**If recon changes the situation, modify your plan.** This is what makes TLPs a dynamic process, not a checklist.

---

## Step 6: Complete the Plan

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 6: Complete the Plan," Terrain Model Checklist*

Update your tentative plan based on what you found on recon. Prepare your briefing aids.

**Build your terrain model. Required elements:**

- North seeking arrow
- Scale (1 pace = X meters)
- Current location / Assembly Area
- ORP location (MP 0586 1552, in woodline west of Bradenton Ave)
- OBJ HERRERA with grid (MP 0602 1565, north side of Jacksonville St / Bradenton Ave junction)
- Jacksonville Street (east-west road) and Bradenton Avenue (north-south road)
- Enemy positions (north side of junction, oriented south and along roads)
- Dense woodlines surrounding the junction on all sides
- Phase lines (if used)
- Primary and alternate routes through the woodline
- SBF position (MP 0601 1552, Bradenton Ave south of OBJ, oriented north)
- Assault route (north through woodline from ORP, then east into OBJ from the west)
- Danger areas (road crossings — Jacksonville St and Bradenton Ave)
- Rally points

**Finalize your OPORD.** Fill in the details from your recon: exact positions, adjusted routes, specific coordination measures, and updated timeline.

---

## Step 7: Issue the Order

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 7: Issue the Order," 5-Paragraph OPORD Format, Coordinating Instructions Checklist*

Deliver your 5-paragraph order to your squad leaders using your terrain model. This is where the OPORD format you just studied becomes the framework for your briefing.

**Brief in order: Situation, Mission, Execution, Sustainment, Command and Signal.**

**Common failures at this step** (from the TLP slides):
- Reading verbatim instead of briefing from knowledge of the plan
- Speaking too quietly — project your voice
- Not using the terrain model — point to locations as you brief them
- Unable to answer questions about the plan
- No confirmation brief — always have subordinates brief back their understanding
- Poor command presence — deliver with confidence and authority

**After issuing the order, conduct a confirmation brief:**
- Have each squad leader brief back their task and purpose
- Verify they understand the concept of the operation and the decisive point
- Confirm they know the timeline, signals, and contingencies

---

## Step 8: Supervise and Refine

*Reference: TLP Slides — "Step 8: Supervise & Refine," Rehearsal Types, PCC/PCI*

This step is continuous — it happens throughout and after all other steps.

**Conduct rehearsals.** Even a short rock drill on the terrain model is valuable:
- Walk through the scheme of maneuver on the terrain model
- Each squad leader traces their element's movement and actions
- Identify the signal to initiate the SBF and the signal to lift/shift fires
- Walk through actions on the objective and consolidation

**Conduct PCC/PCI (Pre-Combat Checks / Pre-Combat Inspections):**
- Weapons, ammunition, water, equipment
- Communications check (radios, batteries)
- **Most important:** Verify every Soldier understands the mission and their specific role

**Continue to refine.** As the situation develops, adjust the plan. If the enemy moves, if weather changes, if you lose a key leader — adapt. TLPs are a dynamic process, not a one-time event.

---

> **INSTRUCTOR WRAP-UP**
>
> The 8 TLP steps applied to this OPORD demonstrate the complete planning process from receiving the mission to crossing the line of departure. Key takeaways for candidates:
>
> 1. **The order gives you information — TLPs tell you what to do with it.** Every paragraph of the OPORD feeds specific TLP steps.
> 2. **Time management is critical.** The 1/3-2/3 rule is not a suggestion. Issue your WARNORD early.
> 3. **Steps 1-3 are sequential; Steps 4-6 are interchangeable.** Do not wait for a perfect plan before initiating movement or reconnaissance.
> 4. **The terrain model is your primary briefing tool.** Build it during planning and use it to deliver your order.
> 5. **Common failures are in Steps 3 and 7** — analysis and order delivery. Master METT-TC analysis and practice briefing with confidence.
