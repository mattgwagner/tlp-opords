## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the railroad tracks, and to the west by the pine forest edge. The planned patrol base site is in a wooded area with good concealment and defensible terrain.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The planned patrol base site at MP 058 152 offers good concealment, defensible terrain, and access to covered withdrawal routes. The surrounding woodlines provide observation points for early warning. A small creek to the south provides a water source but may also canalize enemy approach. Elevated ground to the north offers observation of likely enemy avenues of approach.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility expected during nighttime operations; plan for EENT/BMNT stand-to procedures.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of irregular forces operating in the area who actively patrol and conduct reconnaissance to locate friendly positions. They are equipped with small arms and may have support weapons. They are experienced in local terrain and may attempt to probe or attack friendly positions if discovered.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 6-8 REAPER personnel, small arms, possible support weapons, operating in 2-3 person reconnaissance teams and larger assault elements.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are dispersed throughout the area, conducting patrols and reconnaissance. They maintain observation posts on likely routes and are prepared to report and engage friendly forces. Main body elements are positioned to reinforce reconnaissance teams if contact is made.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance elements detect friendly patrol base and conduct observation to assess strength and disposition. They report findings to higher and may conduct limited probing attacks to test friendly defenses before withdrawing to plan a larger operation.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance detects patrol base occupation and rapidly coordinates a multi-element attack. REAPER forces conduct a coordinated assault using indirect fire, support weapons, and assault elements to overwhelm friendly positions before reinforcements can arrive.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts area security operations in AO COTTO to deny REAPER freedom of movement and enable follow-on offensive operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Establish a secure patrol base to enable continuous operations, maintain security of the platoon, and prepare for follow-on missions. The patrol base must be positioned and organized to allow rapid response to enemy contact while providing for sustainment and rest of the force.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians may be present in the area. Patrol base operations must minimize detection and avoid contact with non-combatants to maintain operational security.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon establishes and occupies Patrol Base THUNDER (vicinity MP 058 152) NLT 2200 to provide security, enable sustainment, and prepare for follow-on operations in AO COTTO.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Establish a secure base in AO COTTO to sustain the platoon, maintain security, and prepare for follow-on offensive operations against REAPER.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Occupy the patrol base without compromise. (2) Establish 360-degree security with LP/OPs and fighting positions. (3) Maintain the ability to defend the base or displace on order.

**End State:** PB THUNDER occupied and secure, security posture maintained through BMNT/EENT cycles, platoon rested and prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon occupies PB THUNDER using a deliberate occupation technique (triangle or cigar-shaped based on terrain). The PL conducts a leader's reconnaissance to confirm site suitability before committing the platoon. Three squads occupy assigned perimeter sectors with interlocking fields of fire. LP/OPs extend early warning onto likely enemy avenues of approach. The platoon executes priorities of work — security, weapons maintenance, rest rotation — while maintaining the ability to defend in place or displace. Stand-to at BMNT and EENT. One squad serves as QRF throughout.

### c. Scheme of Fires
Defensive fires planned for likely REAPER avenues of approach. Each squad responsible for direct fires within assigned sector. 1st Squad, covering the most likely avenue of approach, has priority of indirect fires. Final protective fires (FPF) designated and briefed.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Northern Sector):**

- **TASK:** Occupy and defend the northern sector of PB THUNDER (vicinity MP 058 152). Establish fighting positions with interlocking fields of fire covering the northern avenues of approach. Provide personnel for LP/OP duty on the elevated ground to the north. Conduct local security patrols as directed. Execute priorities of work within the sector.
- **PURPOSE:** Secure the most likely avenue of REAPER approach and provide the earliest warning of enemy reconnaissance or assault, giving the platoon time to react.

**2. 2nd Squad (Southeastern Sector):**

- **TASK:** Occupy and defend the southeastern sector of PB THUNDER. Establish fighting positions with interlocking fields of fire covering the creek line approach and southeastern avenues. Provide personnel for LP/OP duty oriented toward the creek line. Execute priorities of work within the sector.
- **PURPOSE:** Deny REAPER use of the creek line as a covered avenue of approach into the patrol base, preventing infiltration from the south and east.

**3. 3rd Squad (Southwestern Sector / QRF):**

- **TASK:** Occupy and defend the southwestern sector of PB THUNDER. Establish fighting positions with interlocking fields of fire covering the southwestern avenues of approach. Serve as the platoon QRF, prepared to reinforce any sector under attack. Rehearse reinforcement routes to 1st and 2nd Squad sectors. Identify and brief withdrawal routes for the platoon.
- **PURPOSE:** Secure the southwestern perimeter and provide the PL a responsive reserve, ensuring any REAPER probe or assault can be met with concentrated force at the threatened point.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only confirmed enemy combatants posing a threat.
   2. Use graduated response appropriate to the threat.
