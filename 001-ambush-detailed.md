> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Moderate | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Day Iterations)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to conduct a linear ambush along a key supply route to destroy REAPER forces and disrupt REAPER logistics.
>
> **Destination:** OBJ FLUNKER at MP 0601 1538, AO COTTO.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will establish an ORP, move to the ambush site, set up assault, support, and security elements, initiate the ambush on the REAPER convoy, and withdraw in an organized manner.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Simulate a lightly armed convoy with the ability to reinforce or withdraw.
> - Introduce a civilian vehicle or non-combatant to test ROE and decision-making.
> - OPFOR may attempt to flank or counterattack if the ambush is detected early.
> - Cadre can inject communication/equipment failures or unexpected convoy timing changes to challenge flexibility.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the crossroads at MP 0601 1538 and surrounding woodlines, bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the old railroad bed, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** OBJ FLUNKER at MP 0601 1538 is decisive for controlling movement through the area. The adjacent woodlines provide concealment for the assault and support elements. Elevated ground to the north and south offers observation and fields of fire.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of a lightly armed irregular force, likely affiliated with a regional militia group. They are equipped with small arms, possible support weapons, and have experience operating in rural environments. They are capable of basic convoy operations and may attempt to reinforce or withdraw if engaged.

**1. Composition.** 2 vehicles, 6-8 REAPER personnel, AK-47s, possible support weapons (e.g., HMG).

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are typically dispersed in small groups along key supply routes and maintain a low profile to avoid detection. They are prepared to consolidate quickly at critical points if threatened and may use scouts or lookouts to monitor friendly movement.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** Upon initiation of the ambush, REAPER forces return limited, inaccurate fire, then rapidly withdraw along a secondary route to avoid further engagement. They may abandon vehicles or wounded, and attempt to regroup at a safe distance. Reinforcements are unlikely to arrive in time to decisively affect the engagement.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** A nearby REAPER quick reaction force rapidly reinforces the ambushed convoy, coordinating a counterattack with flanking or encirclement maneuvers against the platoon. REAPER forces employ indirect fire or IEDs to disrupt friendly withdrawal and attempts to inflict maximum casualties before friendly forces can break contact.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts ambush operations to disable REAPER supply route in AO COTTO.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Destroy REAPER convoy and seize supplies to ensure safe passage for friendly forces.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians frequent the area. Ambush must minimize risk to non-combatants and avoid civilian casualties to maintain good relations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts an ambush at OBJ FLUNKER (MP 0601 1538) NLT ____ in order to destroy REAPER forces and disrupt REAPER supply lines.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Disrupt REAPER logistics and deny REAPER resupply capability along the supply route through AO COTTO.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Destroy the REAPER convoy. (2) Seize REAPER supplies and materiel. (3) Withdraw without decisive engagement by REAPER reinforcements.

**End State:** REAPER convoy destroyed, supplies seized, friendly forces consolidated at ORP and prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a linear ambush at OBJ FLUNKER. The platoon occupies an ORP, then moves to establish the ambush site along REAPER's expected route of movement. The assault element, as the main effort, initiates the ambush and destroys the convoy. The support element provides flanking suppressive fire to fix the enemy in the kill zone. The security element isolates the ambush site against reinforcement or escape. Upon completion, the platoon withdraws by echelon to the ORP.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has priority of indirect fires. Mortar support available through company on request.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Assault — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Occupy concealed assault positions along the kill zone at OBJ FLUNKER (MP 0601 1538). Initiate the ambush on the PL's signal, destroy REAPER vehicles and personnel with concentrated fires, and seize enemy materiel. Withdraw west to the ORP on order.
- **PURPOSE:** Destroy the convoy before REAPER can organize a response, creating the conditions for the platoon to seize supplies and withdraw.

**2. 2nd Squad (Support — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Occupy a support-by-fire position on the flank of the kill zone. On initiation, deliver suppressive fire to fix REAPER forces in the kill zone. Be prepared to shift fires to block REAPER reinforcements approaching from the north. Withdraw to ORP on order.
- **PURPOSE:** Prevent REAPER from maneuvering out of the kill zone so 1st Squad can destroy the convoy decisively.

**3. 3rd Squad (Security — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Establish a security perimeter vicinity MP 0610 1550 to observe for REAPER reinforcements and cover the flanks and rear of the ambush site. Interdict any REAPER forces attempting to reinforce or withdraw. Collapse security last during platoon withdrawal and consolidate at the ORP.
- **PURPOSE:** Ensure the ambush force is not surprised by REAPER reinforcements, and secure the withdrawal route so the platoon can break contact cleanly.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only valid military targets.
   2. Use minimum force necessary to accomplish the mission.
   3. Avoid civilian casualties and collateral damage.

**2. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR):**
   1. Confirm number and types of vehicles in the REAPER convoy.
   2. Monitor for changes in REAPER route or reinforcements.
   3. Assess civilian presence before execution.

**3. Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR):**
   1. Compromise or detection of friendly positions prior to initiation
   2. Enemy force composition exceeds platoon capability (armored vehicles, crew-served weapons, or reinforced squad+)
   3. Civilian presence in or adjacent to the kill zone at time of execution
   4. Any friendly casualty that reduces the assault element below minimum effective strength

**4. Reporting:**
   - **SALUTE Report:** Upon enemy visual confirmation.
   - **Report to higher when SP'ing or crossing the line of departure.**
   - **In Position Report:** Upon occupying the ambush site or ORP.
