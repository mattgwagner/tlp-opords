Time Zone Used Throughout the Plan/Order: EASTERN STANDARD TIME

Task Organization:

1st Platoon, A Co. 4th BN-211th INF  
Platoon Leader  
Platoon Sergeant  
1st Squad  
2nd Squad  
3rd Squad

**1. SITUATION.**

a. Area of Interest. Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16.

b. Area of Operations.

1. Terrain. Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   a. Key Terrain: OBJ COTTO (bunker) near MP 0600 1540 is the decisive objective and dominates the surrounding area. Woodlines to the west and south provide covered approaches for the assault and support elements. A small knoll north of the bunker offers observation and a support-by-fire position. A concealed trail to the southwest enables a secure withdrawal after the raid.

2. Weather. Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

c. Enemy Forces. The enemy is a determined irregular force, likely associated with a regional militia or paramilitary group. They are equipped with small arms, heavy weapons, and may employ defensive positions and improvised explosive devices. They are experienced in defending fixed positions and may attempt to reinforce or counterattack if threatened. Recent conflicts have demonstrated the widespread use of UAS (drones) for reconnaissance and attack. Enemy and irregular forces may employ commercial or military drones for surveillance, target acquisition, or direct attack. Platoon leaders and squads must account for potential UAS threats during planning, movement, and actions on the objective. Maintain vigilance for aerial threats, use available cover and concealment, and report any UAS sightings immediately.

1. Composition. 4-5 combatants, AK-47s, 1 HMG (Heavy Machine Gun), possible IEDs.

2. Disposition. Enemy forces are positioned in and around fortified defensive locations, utilizing prepared fighting positions and natural cover. They maintain vigilance for approaching threats and are capable of reinforcing their positions or launching counterattacks as needed.

3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA). The enemy defends their position with small arms and prepared obstacles, but if the assault is effective, they withdraw through a pre-planned escape route, prioritizing survival over holding the objective. They may attempt to delay the platoon's advance but do not counterattack in strength.

4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA). The enemy launches a coordinated counterattack with reinforcements during or immediately after the raid, using pre-placed IEDs or booby traps to disrupt friendly movement. They attempt to encircle or cut off the assaulting platoon, inflicting maximum casualties and preventing withdrawal. The enemy uses a UAS to identify friendly positions, adjust indirect fire, or direct the counterattack.

d. Friendly Forces.

1. Higher Headquarters: A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

2. Mission. A Company eliminates enemy forces in AO Starke to secure area for follow-on operations.

3. Commander's Intent. Destroy enemy bunker and hostile forces to allow freedom of movement for friendly forces.

e. Civil Considerations. Civilians reside near AO. Protect non-combatants and prevent collateral damage.

f. Attachments and Detachments. None.

**2. MISSION.**

1st Platoon conducts a raid of OBJ COTTO in AO HERRERA NLT ____ to eliminate enemy forces and secure the area of operations.

**3. EXECUTION.**

a. Concept of Operations. 1st Platoon conducts a raid by establishing an ORP, moving to the objective, and isolating the enemy position. 1st Squad serves as the assault element, breaching and clearing the bunker. 2nd Squad acts as the support element, providing suppressive fire and isolating the objective area. 3rd Squad serves as the security element, securing the flanks and rear, and interdicting enemy reinforcements or escape. Upon completion of the raid, the platoon withdraws in an organized manner to the ORP.

b. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver.

- Squads SP from platoon ORP in squad column.
- 1st Squad breaches bunker; 2nd Squad provides covering fire from elevation; 3rd Squad remains mobile to react to enemy movements.

c. Scheme of Fires. 1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has been allocated two mortar targets for planning: AB001 and AB002. 2nd Squad has priority for 81mm HE mortars on order.

d. Tasks to Subordinate Units:

1. 1st Squad:

   **TASK:** Assault and breach OBJ COTTO at MP 0600 1540, neutralize enemy combatants, and secure the objective.

2. 2nd Squad:

   **TASK:** Provide suppressive fire and support 1st Squad's assault, then assist in clearing and securing the bunker and surrounding area.

   **PURPOSE:** Enable the assault element to breach and clear the objective with minimal casualties.

3. 3rd Squad:

   **TASK:** Establish security around the bunker, observe for and engage enemy reinforcements or flanking elements, and secure the area.

   **PURPOSE:** Prevent enemy interference with the raid and ensure the platoon can consolidate and reorganize after the assault.

- Assign observation and reporting responsibilities for UAS threats within each squad.
- Use terrain, camouflage, and movement discipline to reduce detection by enemy drones.
- Remain aware of the evolving capabilities of enemy and irregular forces, including electronic warfare and commercial drone use.
