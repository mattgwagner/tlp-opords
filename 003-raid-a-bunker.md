## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. AO HERRERA encompasses the area along the Bradenton Avenue corridor between Arcadia Street to the south and Jacksonville Street to the north, bounded to the west by Clearwater Avenue and to the east by the FOB perimeter.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The AO consists of flat terrain with sandy soils and dense pine and hardwood forests throughout. Thick vegetation and tree canopy severely limit observation and fields of fire except along improved roads and clearings. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center of the AO. An unnamed improved road intersects Bradenton Avenue at the objective location, running east-west. These roads are the only locations offering extended fields of fire; visibility in the surrounding woods is under 50 meters in most areas. The terrain is uniformly flat with no significant elevation changes.

   - **Key Terrain:** OBJ COTTO (bunker) at MP 0600 1538, located at the intersection of Bradenton Avenue and the unnamed east-west road. The bunker position controls movement along both road corridors. Bradenton Avenue south of the intersection provides a cleared lane of fire into the objective from the south. The dense woodlines west and southwest of the intersection provide concealed avenues of approach for dismounted assault elements. Bradenton Avenue north of the intersection is the most likely reinforcement route for REAPER. The unnamed road east of the intersection is the most likely escape route.

**2. Weather.** ________ skies, temperature ____°F (heat cat ____), winds ____ at ____ mph. Chance of precipitation: ____%.
BMNT ____; sunrise ____; sunset ____; EENT ____.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are a determined irregular force, likely associated with a regional militia or paramilitary group. They are equipped with small arms, heavy weapons, and may employ defensive positions and improvised explosive devices. They are experienced in defending fixed positions and may attempt to reinforce or counterattack if threatened.

**1. Composition.** 4-5 REAPER combatants, AK-47s, 1 HMG, possible IEDs.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces occupy a fortified bunker position at the intersection of Bradenton Avenue and the unnamed east-west road (MP 0600 1538). Fighting positions are oriented south along Bradenton Avenue and east along the unnamed road. Dense woods to the west and north limit their observation in those directions. They maintain an OP along Bradenton Avenue south of the bunker and are capable of reinforcing from positions further north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces defend from prepared positions using small arms and the HMG, oriented south and east along the road corridors. If the assault is effective, they withdraw east along the unnamed road or north into the dense woods along Bradenton Avenue, prioritizing survival over holding the position. They may employ obstacles or delay measures along approach routes.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces have reinforcements positioned further north along Bradenton Avenue. Upon contact, they launch a counterattack from the north through the woodline while the main body defends in place. They employ pre-placed IEDs or booby traps along Bradenton Avenue south of the bunker to disrupt the support element and the withdrawal route.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company eliminates REAPER forces in AO Starke to secure area for follow-on operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Destroy REAPER bunker and hostile forces to allow freedom of movement for friendly forces.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians reside near AO. Protect non-combatants and prevent collateral damage.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts a raid of OBJ COTTO in AO HERRERA NLT ____ to eliminate REAPER forces and secure the area of operations.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Deny REAPER a fortified defensive position and restore friendly freedom of movement along the Bradenton Avenue corridor in AO HERRERA.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Isolate OBJ COTTO to prevent REAPER reinforcement or escape. (2) Breach and destroy the bunker position. (3) Eliminate REAPER combatants at the objective.

**End State:** OBJ COTTO destroyed, REAPER forces at the objective eliminated, friendly forces consolidated at ORP and prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a raid on OBJ COTTO in two phases. In **Phase 1 (Set)**, the platoon occupies an ORP in the woodline southwest of the objective. The PL conducts a leader's reconnaissance. The security element moves first to isolate the objective, then the support element occupies a position south of the objective to fix the enemy. In **Phase 2 (Strike)**, the support element initiates suppressive fire and the assault element, as the main effort, breaches and clears the bunker from the west. Upon seizure, the platoon withdraws by echelon to the ORP.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has priority of indirect fires. Mortar support available through company on request.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Assault — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Move from the ORP to an assault position near OBJ COTTO. On the PL's signal, assault and clear the fortified bunker position. Eliminate REAPER combatants and signal "objective secured" upon completion. Withdraw to the ORP on order.
- **PURPOSE:** Destroy the bunker and eliminate the defending force so the platoon can complete the raid and withdraw before REAPER reinforcement.

**2. 2nd Squad (Support by Fire — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Occupy a support-by-fire position with observation of OBJ COTTO. On the PL's signal, suppress REAPER positions at the objective. Shift or cease fires on order as 1st Squad enters the objective. Withdraw on order during the platoon withdrawal.
- **PURPOSE:** Fix REAPER in their fighting positions so 1st Squad can close on and breach the bunker without receiving aimed fire.

**3. 3rd Squad (Security — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Move to isolate OBJ COTTO prior to the assault. Block REAPER reinforcement and escape routes. Maintain positions through the assault. Collapse security last during platoon withdrawal and consolidate at the ORP.
- **PURPOSE:** Isolate the objective so REAPER cannot reinforce or escape during the assault, ensuring 1st Squad fights only the force currently at the bunker.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only confirmed enemy combatants.
   2. Use graduated response appropriate to the threat.
   3. Avoid civilian harm and minimize collateral damage.
   4. Report civilian casualties immediately.

**2. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR):**
   1. Confirm REAPER positions and strength at OBJ COTTO, specifically their orientation along Bradenton Avenue and the unnamed east-west road.
   2. Identify REAPER reinforcement positions north along Bradenton Avenue or along Avenue C.
   3. Confirm presence of IEDs or obstacles along Bradenton Avenue south of the bunker and along approach routes.
   4. Assess civilian presence near the objective, particularly along the unnamed east-west road.

**3. Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR):**
   1. Enemy strength at OBJ COTTO exceeds expected composition (reinforced or crew-served weapons present)
   2. IED or obstacle on approach routes preventing timely assault
   3. Compromise of the assault force prior to actions on the objective
   4. Any friendly casualty during the assault requiring immediate MEDEVAC
   5. Civilian presence at or near the bunker complex

**4. Reporting:**
   - **Report to higher when SP'ing or crossing the line of departure.**
   - **In Position Report:** Upon occupying the ORP or objective.
   - **LACE Report:** At least once during operation and upon re-establishment of ORP.
   - **SALUTE Report:** Upon sighting enemy forces or indicators.

**5.** This OPORD is effective immediately upon distribution.
