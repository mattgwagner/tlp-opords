**1. SITUATION.**

a. Area of Interest. Northeast Florida, Clay County in the vicinity of Starke (IVO Starke), designated as AO Starke.

b. Area of Operations.

1. Terrain. Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

2. Weather. Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

c. Enemy Forces. The enemy is a determined irregular force, likely associated with a regional militia or paramilitary group. They are equipped with small arms, heavy weapons, and may employ defensive positions and improvised explosive devices. They are experienced in defending fixed positions and may attempt to reinforce or counterattack if threatened.

1. Composition. 4-5 combatants, AK-47s, 1 HMG (Heavy Machine Gun), possible IEDs.

2. Disposition. Enemy forces are positioned in and around fortified defensive locations, utilizing prepared fighting positions and natural cover. They maintain vigilance for approaching threats and are capable of reinforcing their positions or launching counterattacks as needed.

3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA). The enemy defends their position with small arms and prepared obstacles, but if the assault is effective, they withdraw through a pre-planned escape route, prioritizing survival over holding the objective. They may attempt to delay the platoon's advance but do not counterattack in strength.

4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA). The enemy launches a coordinated counterattack with reinforcements during or immediately after the raid, using pre-placed IEDs or booby traps to disrupt friendly movement. They attempt to encircle or cut off the assaulting platoon, inflicting maximum casualties and preventing withdrawal.

d. Friendly Forces.

1. Higher Headquarters: A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

2. Mission. A Company eliminates enemy forces in AO Starke to secure area for follow-on operations.

3. Commander's Intent. Destroy enemy bunker and hostile forces to allow freedom of movement for friendly forces.

e. Civil Considerations. Civilians reside near AO. Protect non-combatants and prevent collateral damage.

f. Attachments and Detachments. None.
