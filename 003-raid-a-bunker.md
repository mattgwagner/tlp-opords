## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. AO HERRERA encompasses the area along the Bradenton Avenue corridor between Arcadia Street to the south and Jacksonville Street to the north, bounded to the west by Clearwater Avenue and to the east by the FOB perimeter.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The AO consists of flat terrain with sandy soils and dense pine and hardwood forests throughout. Thick vegetation and tree canopy severely limit observation and fields of fire except along improved roads and clearings. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center of the AO. An unnamed improved road intersects Bradenton Avenue at the objective location, running east-west. These roads are the only locations offering extended fields of fire; visibility in the surrounding woods is under 50 meters in most areas. The terrain is uniformly flat with no significant elevation changes.

   - **Key Terrain:** OBJ COTTO (bunker) at MP 0600 1538, located at the intersection of Bradenton Avenue and the unnamed east-west road. The bunker position controls movement along both road corridors. Bradenton Avenue south of the intersection provides a cleared lane of fire into the objective from the south. The dense woodlines west and southwest of the intersection provide concealed avenues of approach for dismounted assault elements. Bradenton Avenue north of the intersection is the most likely reinforcement route for REAPER. The unnamed road east of the intersection is the most likely escape route.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are a determined irregular force, likely associated with a regional militia or paramilitary group. They are equipped with small arms, heavy weapons, and may employ defensive positions and improvised explosive devices. They are experienced in defending fixed positions and may attempt to reinforce or counterattack if threatened.

**1. Composition.** 4-5 REAPER combatants, AK-47s, 1 HMG, possible IEDs.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces occupy a fortified bunker position at the intersection of Bradenton Avenue and the unnamed east-west road (MP 0600 1538). Fighting positions are oriented south along Bradenton Avenue and east along the unnamed road. Dense woods to the west and north limit their observation in those directions. They maintain an OP along Bradenton Avenue south of the bunker and are capable of reinforcing from positions further north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces defend from prepared positions using small arms and the HMG, oriented south and east along the road corridors. If the assault is effective, they withdraw east along the unnamed road or north into the dense woods along Bradenton Avenue, prioritizing survival over holding the position. They may employ obstacles or delay measures along approach routes.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces have reinforcements positioned further north along Bradenton Avenue. Upon contact, they launch a counterattack from the north through the woodline while the main body defends in place. They employ pre-placed IEDs or booby traps along Bradenton Avenue south of the bunker to disrupt the support element and the withdrawal route.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company eliminates REAPER forces in AO Starke to secure area for follow-on operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Destroy REAPER bunker and hostile forces to allow freedom of movement for friendly forces.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians reside near AO. Protect non-combatants and prevent collateral damage.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts a raid of OBJ COTTO in AO HERRERA NLT ____ to eliminate REAPER forces and secure the area of operations.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**1. Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon eliminates REAPER forces and destroys the bunker to deny REAPER a defensive position and enable friendly freedom of movement.

**2. Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to eliminate REAPER forces and destroy the bunker to deny REAPER a base of operations and allow freedom of movement for friendly forces in AO HERRERA.

**3. End State.** REAPER bunker is destroyed, REAPER forces are eliminated, and friendly forces have freedom of movement in AO HERRERA.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a raid on OBJ COTTO by establishing an ORP vicinity MP 0586 1530 in the woodline southwest of the objective. The platoon leader conducts a leader's reconnaissance to confirm enemy positions at the bunker. 3rd Squad moves first to establish security, blocking the Bradenton Avenue corridor north of the objective and the unnamed road east of the objective to isolate the bunker. 2nd Squad establishes a support-by-fire position south of the objective on Bradenton Avenue (IVO MP 0600 1530), oriented north. On the PL's signal, 2nd Squad initiates suppressive fire north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor. 1st Squad, as the assault element, moves from the ORP north through the woodline and assaults the bunker from the west, breaching and clearing the position. Upon completion of the raid, the platoon withdraws west into the woodline and south to the ORP.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Platoon moves to the ORP (MP 0586 1530) through the woodline west of Bradenton Avenue using a file formation and traveling overwatch.
- PL conducts leader's reconnaissance to confirm enemy positions and finalize assault plan.
- 3rd Squad departs ORP first and moves to establish blocking positions: one team north along Bradenton Avenue (IVO MP 0600 1545) to interdict reinforcements, one team east along the unnamed road (IVO MP 0608 1538) to block escape.
- 2nd Squad moves east from the ORP to a support-by-fire position on Bradenton Avenue south of the bunker (IVO MP 0600 1530), oriented north.
- 1st Squad moves north from the ORP through the dense woodline to an assault position west of the bunker.
- On the PL's signal, 2nd Squad initiates suppressive fire north along Bradenton Avenue into the bunker.
- On order, 1st Squad assaults east through the objective from the west, breaching and clearing the bunker position.
- Upon completion, 1st Squad signals objective secured. Platoon withdraws by echelon: 1st Squad withdraws west into the woodline, 2nd Squad breaks contact south, 3rd Squad collapses security last. All elements consolidate at the ORP.
- Platoon withdraws south from the ORP.

### d. Scheme of Fires
2nd Squad, as the support-by-fire element, has priority of fires during the assault phase. 1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has priority of indirect fires. Mortar support available through company on request.

### e. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Assault):**

- **TASK:** Move north through the woodline from the ORP to an assault position west of OBJ COTTO. On order, assault east through the bunker position at MP 0600 1538, breach and clear the fortified position, and neutralize REAPER combatants.
- **PURPOSE:** Destroy REAPER defensive positions and eliminate threats to enable freedom of movement for friendly forces.

**2. 2nd Squad (Support by Fire):**

- **TASK:** Establish a support-by-fire position on Bradenton Avenue south of OBJ COTTO (IVO MP 0600 1530), oriented north. On the PL's signal, suppress REAPER positions at the bunker with fires north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor. Shift or cease fires on order as 1st Squad enters the objective.
- **PURPOSE:** Fix REAPER forces in place and enable the assault element to breach and clear the objective with minimal casualties.

**3. 3rd Squad (Security):**

- **TASK:** Establish blocking positions to isolate OBJ COTTO. Alpha Team blocks north along Bradenton Avenue (IVO MP 0600 1545) to interdict REAPER reinforcements. Bravo Team blocks east along the unnamed road (IVO MP 0608 1538) to prevent REAPER escape. Maintain positions through the assault and withdraw last during platoon withdrawal.
- **PURPOSE:** Isolate the objective, prevent REAPER reinforcement or escape, and ensure the platoon can conduct an organized withdrawal after the raid.
