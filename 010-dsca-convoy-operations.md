## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
State of Florida, from Camp Blanding Joint Training Center (Clay County) to Bay County (Panama City area). Hurricane DELTA made landfall 72 hours ago as a Category 3 hurricane, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, power grid, and transportation networks in the Florida Panhandle. Route distance is approximately 200 miles. Major highways in the region include I-10, US-90, US-231, and US-98.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The region between Camp Blanding and Bay County consists of flat to gently rolling terrain with pine forests, agricultural areas, and small towns. Urban areas in the region include Lake City, Tallahassee, and Panama City. Infrastructure damage increases approaching Bay County.

   - **Key Terrain:** Camp Blanding Assembly Area (SP), Bay County Staging Area in Panama City (RP). Fuel availability is limited in the affected area; plan fuel stops accordingly. Major highway interchanges and urban bypass routes may experience congestion.

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear skies, temperature 75-85°F, humidity 70-80%. Roads may have standing water in low-lying areas. Debris fields throughout Bay County.

### c. Civil Considerations
Hurricane DELTA caused significant damage to Bay County and surrounding areas. Power outages are widespread—expect non-functional traffic signals. Fuel availability is limited. Emergency services are overwhelmed. Civilian population is stressed and may approach military convoys seeking assistance.

**1. Infrastructure Status:**
   - Power: 80% of Bay County without power; degraded along route approaching affected area
   - Communications: Cell service intermittent; some towers damaged
   - Fuel: Stations may be closed or out of fuel due to power outages and panic buying
   - Traffic Signals: Non-operational in affected areas

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN, 211th INF, supporting Florida National Guard Joint Task Force – Hurricane DELTA.

**2. Battalion Mission.** 4th Battalion provides logistics and security support to Hurricane DELTA relief operations in the Florida Panhandle.

**3. Battalion Commander's Intent.** Deliver relief supplies safely and efficiently to enable humanitarian assistance operations. Maintain unit integrity and accountability. Support civil authorities while maintaining military discipline and readiness.

**4. Adjacent Units:**
   - B Company: Operating POD sites in Bay County
   - C Company: Conducting route clearance operations on US-98

### e. Attachments and Detachments
None.
