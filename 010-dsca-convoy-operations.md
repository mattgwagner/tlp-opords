> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Moderate | **Recommended Phase:** WALK (Blocks 2-3), RUN (Day Iterations)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to conduct a logistics convoy from Camp Blanding Joint Training Center to Bay County, FL to deliver emergency relief supplies in support of Hurricane DELTA relief operations.
>
> **Destination:** Bay County Staging Area, Panama City, FL (approximately 200 miles west of Camp Blanding).
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will conduct convoy operations using appropriate movement techniques, maintain convoy integrity and security throughout movement, navigate around obstacles and damaged infrastructure, and deliver supplies to the designated staging area.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD introduces DSCA (Defense Support of Civil Authorities) operations and convoy planning. Candidates focus on route planning, convoy discipline, communications during extended movement, and decision-making in degraded infrastructure environments. Good introduction to real-world National Guard domestic operations.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 90 minutes (simulated). AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Power outages causing traffic signals to be inoperable (test convoy discipline at uncontrolled intersections).
> - Fuel stations empty or inoperable due to civilian run on fuel (test contingency planning and range management).
> - Blocked routes requiring immediate rerouting decisions.
> - Vehicle breakdown requiring recovery procedures.
> - Civilians flagging down convoy requesting assistance.
> - Debris on roadway requiring clearance or bypass.
> - Communication dead zones requiring alternate reporting methods.
> - Accident scene requiring first aid and traffic control.
> - Evacuee traffic causing congestion on primary routes.
> - Simulated injury during movement requiring CASEVAC procedures.
>
> **NOTE:** This is a DSCA operation. There is no enemy threat, but security awareness and discipline remain important.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
State of Florida, primary route from Camp Blanding Joint Training Center (Clay County) to Bay County via I-10 and US-231. Hurricane DELTA made landfall 72 hours ago as a Category 3 hurricane, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, power grid, and transportation networks in the Florida Panhandle.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The convoy route follows major highways through north-central Florida to the Panhandle region. Terrain is generally flat with pine forests, agricultural areas, and small towns along the route. Urban areas include Lake City, Tallahassee, and Panama City. Infrastructure damage increases as the convoy approaches Bay County.

   - **Key Terrain:** I-10/I-75 interchange (potential congestion), Tallahassee bypass routes, US-231 corridor into Bay County. Fuel stops at Lake City (CP2) and Tallahassee (CP4). Bay County Staging Area at Panama City.

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear skies, temperature 75-85°F, humidity 70-80%. Roads may have standing water in low-lying areas. Debris fields possible throughout Bay County.

### c. Civil Considerations
Hurricane DELTA caused significant damage to Bay County and surrounding areas. Civilian population is stressed and may approach military convoys seeking assistance. Power outages are widespread (expect non-functional traffic signals). Fuel availability is limited due to civilian panic buying and power outages affecting fuel pumps. Emergency services are overwhelmed. Local, state, and federal agencies are conducting concurrent relief operations.

**1. Population.** Approximately 180,000 residents in Bay County. Many displaced, sheltering in place, or evacuated. High civilian activity on roadways.

**2. Infrastructure.** Power grid damaged (80% without power in Bay County). Cell towers damaged (communications degraded). Gas stations may be closed or out of fuel. Traffic signals non-operational in affected areas.

**3. Key Facilities.** Bay County Emergency Operations Center, Panama City hospitals, designated shelter locations.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF, supporting the Florida National Guard Joint Task Force – Hurricane DELTA.

**2. Mission.** A Company provides logistics support to Hurricane DELTA relief operations by transporting emergency supplies from Camp Blanding to forward staging areas in the affected region.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Deliver relief supplies safely and efficiently to enable continued humanitarian assistance operations. Maintain convoy discipline and accountability throughout movement. Assist civilians when feasible without compromising the primary mission.

### e. Attachments and Detachments
None.

**2. Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to deliver emergency relief supplies to enable humanitarian assistance operations for citizens affected by Hurricane DELTA.

**3. End State.** Relief supplies are delivered to the Bay County Staging Area, convoy personnel and equipment are accounted for, and the platoon is prepared for follow-on missions.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a logistics convoy from Camp Blanding to Bay County using primary highways. The convoy maintains proper intervals, communication, and discipline throughout movement. The platoon conducts scheduled halts at designated checkpoints for refueling, accountability, and rest. Upon encountering obstacles, blocked routes, or civilian emergencies, the convoy commander makes decisions based on mission priority and available resources. Upon arrival at the staging area, the platoon delivers supplies, conducts accountability, and prepares for return convoy or follow-on operations.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Convoy formation: Lead vehicle (PL HMMWV), LMTV #1, LMTV #2, LMTV #3, Trail vehicle (PSG HMMWV).
- Maintain 50-100 meter intervals between vehicles (adjust for traffic conditions).
- Movement speed: Posted speed limits; reduce speed in damaged/debris areas.
- Scheduled halts: CP2 (Lake City) for fuel/accountability, CP4 (Tallahassee) for fuel/rest, CP6 (Bay County Staging Area) for mission completion.
- Lost vehicle procedures: Stop at last known location, contact convoy commander, await guidance.
