## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
State of Florida, from Camp Blanding Joint Training Center (Clay County) to Bay County via I-10 and US-231. Hurricane DELTA made landfall 72 hours ago as a Category 3 hurricane, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, power grid, and transportation networks in the Florida Panhandle.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The convoy route follows major highways through north-central Florida to the Panhandle region. Terrain is generally flat with pine forests, agricultural areas, and small towns along the route. Urban areas include Lake City, Tallahassee, and Panama City. Infrastructure damage increases approaching Bay County. Route distance is approximately 200 miles.

   - **Key Terrain:** I-10/I-75 interchange, Tallahassee bypass, US-231 corridor into Bay County. Fuel points at Lake City and Tallahassee. Bay County Staging Area at Panama City.

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear skies, temperature 75-85°F, humidity 70-80%. Roads may have standing water in low-lying areas. Debris fields throughout Bay County.

### c. Civil Considerations
Hurricane DELTA caused significant damage to Bay County and surrounding areas. Power outages are widespread—expect non-functional traffic signals. Fuel availability is limited. Emergency services are overwhelmed. Civilian population is stressed and may approach military convoys seeking assistance.

**1. Infrastructure Status:**
   - Power: 80% of Bay County without power; degraded along route approaching affected area
   - Communications: Cell service intermittent; some towers damaged
   - Fuel: Stations may be closed or out of fuel due to power outages and panic buying
   - Traffic Signals: Non-operational in affected areas
