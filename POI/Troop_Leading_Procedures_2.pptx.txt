Motivator
People formulate plans both consciously and subconsciously throughout everyday life for any number of tasks or events that they carry out. In the military, plans are the basis for any mission. To develop their plan (concept of the operation), the leader summarizes how best to accomplish their mission within the scope of the commander’s intent one and two levels up. The leader uses TLP to turn the concept into a fully developed plan and to prepare a concise, accurate operation order (OPORD). They assign additional tasks (and outlines their purpose) for subordinate elements, allocates available resources, and establishes priorities to make the concept work. The following periods of instruction and practical exercise covers important aspects of order development.

Terminal Learning Objective
TASK: Conduct Troop Leading Procedures.

CONDITIONS: In a classroom environment, given instruction on TLPs and a scenario.

STANDARDS: Officer Candidates are able to work in small groups to make plans for given scenarios using the Troop Leading Procedures and brief those plans to the class.


Learn Step Activity 2
TASK: Make a Tentative Plan.

CONDITIONS: In a classroom environment, given instruction on TLPs and a scenario.

STANDARDS: Officer Candidates are able to work in small groups to make tentative plans for given scenarios using the Troop Leading Procedures.


Troop Leading Procedures
Step 3:
Make a Tentative Plan

Troop Leading Procedures

The order of these steps doesn’t change 



Steps 4-7 are interchangeable.  
 

Step 8 occurs throughout  the process.
1. Receive the Mission 
2. Issue a Warning Order 
3. Make a Tentative Plan 
4. Initiate Movement 
5. Conduct Reconnaissance 
6. Complete the Plan 
7. Issue the Order 
8. Supervise and Refine

Step 3: Make a Tentative Plan
Step three of TLPs -  Make a Tentative Plan.

Mission Analysis 🡪 TMTCET
Course of Action (COA) Development 🡪 AGADAP
COA Analysis 🡪 War-Game
COA Comparison
COA Selection

If the LDR (due to time constraints), is unable to develop more than one COA, step 4 and 5 do not apply


1. Mission Analysis
Use TMTCET to conduct mission analysis.

Mission analysis answers the four questions of the leader’s visualization:
What is my mission?
What is the current situation?
How do we accomplish the mission?
What are the risks?

Summary of mission analysis
Restated mission
Initial risk assessment
Tentative decisive point
Initial commander’s intent


2. COA Development
Use AGADAP to develop the COA.

COA Screening Criteria at the end of COA Dev, COA must be:
Suitable (appropriate for particular person, purpose, situation)
Acceptable (able to be agreed on, tolerated, allowed)
Distinguishable (clear enough to be discerned or identified as different)
Complete (entire or full)
Feasible (possible to do easily)

COA Includes
Purpose of the operation
Form of maneuver or defensive technique
Decisive point and why
Risk and mitigation
Decisive operation with task and purpose
Shaping operation with task and purpose
Concept of fires/assets
End State


3. COA Analysis
COA Analysis is the “War Game.” 
Action🡪 Reaction🡪 Counteraction






4. COA Comparison
5. COA Selection

Briefly explain what COA Analysis is. Touch on COA Comparison and COA Selection, don’t spend time on it.

Mission
HIGHER HEADQUARTERS
Squad Leaders must know what his Company CDR’s and Platoon Leader’s want  accomplished:

Two Levels Up Concept/Intent

One Level Up Concept

A-27. Leaders understand their second higher up concepts of the operation. They identify the tasks and purposes, and how their immediate higher up are contributing to the fight. They also must understand leaders' intent (two levels up).


Mission
UNIT PURPOSE
YOUR purpose is located in the concepts of the operation in the immediate higher headquarters OPORD and usually matches or achieves the purpose of the immediate higher headquarters.
Shaping operation purposes must relate directly to those of the decisive operation.
Understand how the units purposes relate to higher.
Understand why their leaders one level up assigned their unit’s particular purposes. 
Determine how those fit into the superior’s concepts of the operation.


Mission
Constraints
Take the form of a proscriptive/ prohibitive actions. TIME IS ALWAYS A CONSTRAINT.



Prohibitive Action:
Do not cross PL Blue until directed
No indirect fires within 100 meters of buildings
Do not initiate unless fired upon

Proscriptive Action:
Recon route prior to LD
Establish MFP 1
Establish EPW collection point
Consolidate casualties at Company CCP


Mission
Specified Tasks - Tasks that are clearly stated in the order, during the oral order or in overlays and annexes.

Implied Tasks - Tasks that become apparent as the OPORD is analyzed. Not inherent, routine, or standard operating procedure (SOP). Must be performed to accomplish a specified task.

Mission
Essential Task
An Essential task is a clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by soldiers or units.  These tasks will be oriented in one of three ways:

Decisive Operation: since the purposes are the same the essential task also accomplishes the higher headquarters’ purpose.	
Shaping Operation: accomplishes the assigned purpose, which shapes the decisive operation.	
Sustaining Operation: accomplishes the assigned purpose, which enables both the shaping and decisive operation.

31

Mission
The Mission Statement answers who, what, where, when, why and will contain the mission essential task.

The assigned essential task is included in the mission statement or Course of Action (COA) statement and is the task you must achieve to accomplish the mission

Mission
Nesting
When analyzing the mission you will see that the “why” or purpose for the mission is always nested.
There are two types of “nesting” – horizontal and vertical nesting.
Vertical nesting is the nesting of the purpose up and down the chain of command.
Horizontal nesting is the nesting of purposes oriented around the decisive operation.


In other words the decisive operation will have the same purpose as the higher unit, and the purposes of the adjacent units will all support the decisive operation.

Terrain and Weather
Step One: Define the Operational Environment
Area of Operations (AO)—A geographical area, including the airspace above, usually defined by lateral, forward, and rear boundaries assigned to a commander, by a higher commander, in which he has responsibility and the authority to conduct military operations.

A briefing technique is OBTF:
Orient your audience to the map/terrain model
Box the boundaries of the map/terrain model for your AO
Trace through the map/terrain model identifying what the graphics or items represent
Familiarize the audience with the map/terrain model by identifying key features they will recognize while conducting the operation

42

Terrain and Weather
Step One: Define the Operational Environment
Area of Interest (AI)—A geographical area…[that] includes any threat forces or characteristics of the battlefield environment that will significantly influence accomplishment of the command’s mission. 

AI is determined in terms of C.A.R.O.
C- Enemy air assets CAS/CCA (fixed or rotary wing)
A- Artillery or mortars (Indirect fires)
R- Reserves/Reinforcements (ability to employ reserves on your Objective)
O- Other (UAS)
NOTE: Areas of Interest are doctrinally not within our Area of Operations.

44

Terrain and Weather
Step Two: Describe the Environmental Effects on Operations
What do we mean by describe the effects?
Anybody can define the environment by saying this is a hill, this is a ravine, that’s a river, etc.  Good leaders determine what this means to the enemy and their unit and how it will effect the fight.  Subordinates expect leaders to make these deductions and develop plans to mitigate or exploit these effects.
Don’t forget that you must always describe the effects on the enemy and on yourself and determine what you will do about it.
45

Terrain and Weather
Step Two: Describe the Environmental Effects on Operations









Notice how each aspect that we define means something to the fight and forces us to adjust our operation to mitigate or exploit the effect


Define the Terrain
Numerous Creeks
Main intersection
Only one avenue of approach from objective
Observation limited to 35 to 40 meters
Sparsely vegetated concealment
Describe it’s effects
This will slow our movement 
Allows movement throughout sector
The enemy will have only one mounted escape route
We will have to get close to the objective to engage
Enemy will be able to more easily detect our movement
What will you do about the effect (SO WHAT) 
Provide more time for movement
We will have to control this intersection
We must isolate this avenue of approach to prevent enemy withdrawal
BPT fight into SBF and move to staging positions before final approach
We must slow our movement, conduct SLHs more often and use our thermals every 100m-200m

Who do these Favor/How/Why? 


Terrain and Weather
Obstacles
Existing Obstacles:
Natural obstacles involve terrain, topography, and/or physical characteristics that affect or impede movement
Man-made obstacles involve human influence to affect or impede maneuver or arrangement
Reinforcing Obstacles:
Tactical Obstacles: Those obstacles employed to disrupt enemy formations, to turn them into a desired area, to fix them in position under direct and indirect fires, or to block enemy penetrations.
Protective Obstacles: Obstacles employed to assist a unit in its local, close-in protection. 

Terrain and Weather
Obstacles
 The terrain itself can actually be an obstacle.  This is indicated by classifying the terrain.
Classification of Terrain
Unrestricted: Indicates terrain free of constraints to movement. Nothing needs to be done to enhance mobility.
Restricted: Hinders movement to some degree. Little effort is needed to enhance mobility but units are unable to move at desired speeds or combat formations.
Severely Restricted: Hinders or slows movement in combat formations unless some effort is made to enhance mobility (i.e. Engineer Assets).


Terrain and Weather
Types of Terrain
5 major terrain features
Hill, Ridge, Valley, Saddle, Depression

 5 minor terrain features
Draw, Spur, Cut, Fill, Cliff

Briefly define the features and identify them in the following slide, but let them be taught in depth at land navigation training.
50

Terrain and Weather

Terrain and Weather
Avenues of Approach
An air or ground route of an attacking force of a given size leading to its objective or to key terrain in its path.
Mobility Corridors fall into Avenues of Approach
Areas where a force will be canalized due to terrain restrictions.  They allow military forces to capitalize on the principles of mass and speed.



In this slide we are letting candidates know mobility corridors exist and what they are, but inform them not to focus heavily on them at this level.
52

Terrain and Weather
Practical Exercise
Break into small groups and take 5 minutes to discuss what Avenue of Approach you think is best and why. Be prepared to provide an answer for the group.
OBJ
Ask which Avenue of Approach appears to be the best to get to the objective assuming the terrain is densely vegetated around the creeks, less vegetated on the hilltops, and that we are moving to attack an enemy that is located on the OBJ. 
Explain the middle Avenue of Approach would be the best because the IV line on the ridge blocks observation from the north while at the same time using the IV lines created by draws/spurs to helps to limit observation from the East and West, while the vegetation near the creeks also provides better concealment. If the knowledge base appears high you can explain there probably would be enemy pre-planned targets for the hilltops.
53

Terrain and Weather
Key Terrain
Any locality or area the seizure, retention, or control of affords a marked advantage to either combatant (marked advantage to you or the enemy).
Examples:
Terrain with good observation over AAs
Terrain providing cover of an obstacle
Road junctions or communication centers that are central to operations
When developing and briefing key terrain you must talk about what the terrain is, why it is key, and what you will do about this terrain? Bypass it, seize it, indirect fire target, etc.

K1

Terrain and Weather
Observation and Fields of Fire
Observation  is the ability to see the threat either visually or through use of surveillance devices (NVG, thermals, etc).

Fields of Fire  are areas that a weapon or group of weapons may effectively cover with fire from a given position.

When talking about observation and fields of fire, talk about what you can see and engage, and what the enemy can see and engage.  How will limited visibility effect your observation?  Will weather like early morning fog effect your observation?  


Terrain and Weather
Cover and Concealment
Cover is protection from the effects of direct and indirect fires.

Concealment is protection from observation.

Armor, protective obstacles, buildings, trees, trenches, etc. will all have an effect on cover for you and the enemy.  Don’t forget about concealment from aerial observation as well as ground observation.
Highlight critical areas and what types of cover and quality are available (what size rounds will they provide cover from)
Highlight areas lacking cover or areas with only concealment

How do I depict my terrain analysis?

In order to graphically display our analysis we will draw a graphical terrain overlay (GTAO).  A good graphical terrain overlay will have a huge impact on getting your point across to your men.

When drawing your GTAO there are specific colors used for each aspect of the terrain:
O	BSTACLES (drawn in green)
A	VENUES OF APPROACH (drawn in red or blue)
K	EY TERRAIN (drawn in purple)
O	BSERVATION AND FIELDS OF FIRE (ranges drawn in black)
C   	OVER AND CONCEALMENT

Two Outputs from Terrain Analysis

The worksheet is a way of showing the deductions, the “so what?”
The GTAO is a required product according to ATP 3-21.8, but it will not be a required product here, a terrain model will suffice.
The next slides will show the process of building a GTAO for candidates situational awareness and reference to look back to if they desire. Explain the analysis shown briefly for each of the next seven slides.

Cloud Cover
Precipitation
Temperature
Visibility
Wind




Can weather really effect our operation that much?


68

Terrain and Weather
Visibility
 Low visibility (<3Km) limits employment of aircraft, aerial sensors, and airborne forces
  May canalize attacking forces onto well defined Avenues of Approach
  BMNT, SR, SS, EENT, MR, MS
  Limited visibility due to night, fog, rain




Poor visibility may force us to utilize NVG, thermals, etc.  It will also help conceal us from enemy observation.

69

Terrain and Weather
Wind
Upwind force generally has better visibility
Speed and direction can have significant impact on smoke and NBC operations
Wind carries noise and scent
Heavy winds can mask noise and allow for rapid movement
Winds will be canalized in urban environments
Speed and direction of surface and altitude winds favor upwind force
Upwind force generally has better visibility
Speed and direction have significant impact on smoke and NBC Operations
Described as “from-to”
Focus on smoke, smells, and masking sound.
70

Terrain and Weather
Precipitation
Heavy rains will effect visibility and can effect level of activity of all forces.
Rain and snow can combine with chemicals to create “hot spots” in low-lying areas.
Mist can distribute chemicals more evenly and create high vapor concentrations
Can have significant effect on road washout and trafficability
Snow will reduce effectiveness of indirect fires, mines, and grenades by reducing the velocity of shrapnel
Rain will reduce the overall effectiveness of NVGs and thermals
Focus on visibility, sound, movement.
71

Terrain and Weather
Cloud Cover
Altitude of cloud cover influences aviation operations
Can reduce overall illumination and visibility
Can effect laser guided munitions (copperhead, hellfire, etc)
Greater than 70% cloud cover creates neutral gradient conditions which favor smoke and chemical munitions
Cloud cover can reduce temperature by blocking the sun, but can also increase temperatures during the night by trapping heat
Focus on illumination at night and that it can affect air.
72

Terrain and Weather
Temperature and Humidity
Hot and cold temperatures will effect personnel and equipment performance.  You must train in all conditions (try magazine changes and weapon operation in extreme cold).
Humidity (air density) will effect smoke operations and aircraft payloads
Hot weather may cause increased stress and frustration for enemy forces, friendly forces, and civilians (civil disorder) and can also significantly reduce activity
Additional risk mitigation must be in place for extreme hot and cold weather

Takeaway’s from Enemy Disposition are not just where the enemy is on the map but how the enemy plans to fight you.

The enemy’s plan is not to wait for you to show up and then die in place, they are going to fight, and they won’t plan to fail.  They have a task and purpose and you need to determine that in order to figure out how they will fight you.

Develop the enemy:
Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA) – the plan you think the enemy will most likely execute based off the information provided and analysis made.
AND IF YOU HAVE TIME


*NOTE: You should use AGADAP to develop your enemy*

 
Granted the enemy you’ll face here will generally only be 2-3 personnel, this means it will be relatively simple to go through the process of AGADAP to develop the ENY MP/DCOA so developing COAs will be easier in the future.
83

Enemy
Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA) – the worst case scenario the enemy could confront you with based off the information provided.
Generally the greatest difference between the MPCOA and MDCOA is how the enemy arrays themselves on the battlefield with little to no change in disposition, composition, or strength. The more dangerous the COA, generally the more risk the enemy exposes themselves to.

Think like the enemy would! And you really need to develop both COAs, but MPCOA takes priority


Enemy
Most Probable/Dangerous Course of Action
Describe how you think the enemy will fight you from start to finish (be specific and use doctrine).
If you were the enemy, how would you fight based upon their task and purpose using the resources that they have. 
Your plan should fight this.
Brief the enemy plan using the Terrain Model or Graphics you have developed. 
SHOW enemy locations, weapon systems, kill zones, max ranges of weapon systems, retrograde routes, reinforcement routes, etc.

Explain the list of things to show the enemy on the bottom of the slide isn’t all inclusive, but are just some of things that need to be shown. Explain how depicting these things can help you to understand your maneuver and develop your plan later. For example that initial SBF position doesn’t look so good anymore if you have to maneuver well within the range of the enemies primary kill zone without support.
85

Enemy
Ensure subordinate understand differences between:

What you know 

What you suspect

What you template (estimates).
Explain not to brief assumptions as facts. Only brief what higher tells you is a fact as a fact, everything else is analysis/assumption/best guess.
86

Check On Learning
If your 1 level up provides their information on the enemy the unit faces, what must you do with that information?

Define: Disposition, Composition, Strength, Capabilities, MPCOA/MDCOA

What is the difference between MPCOA and MDCOA?

Practical Exercise: Break in small groups for 3-5 minutes and discuss any item where you need to consider worst case scenario and most likely: interviews, sports play, investing, trying to get away with something your not supposed to do at OCS and the Cadre most likely COA and dangerous COA to catch you. You can think back to the discussion on how you applied mission variables in the past from the first block of instruction.

Build the enemy you face at your level with the information provided from higher
See above slide or reference
How the enemy arrays its force on the battlefield
Practical exercise think of a personal experience or one in relation to OCS and share before breaking them into groups.

Determining the troops you have available for the mission will effect how you will be able to accomplish the mission.

Determining the elements you have to accomplish the mission will drive your task organization to include attachments/detachments.

Task organization is the first thing you will brief in your operations order.

We have completed Mission Analysis.  Now we are going to take all of that analysis and everything we deduced to develop our course of action.

COA Development
The purpose of COA DEV is to determine one or multiple ways to accomplish the mission.

A COA describes how the unit will generate overwhelming combat power against the enemy at the decisive point while mitigating risks/casualties.

Start planning from the decisive point and work back toward the start of the mission.


COA Development
Decisive Operation:  Those that directly accomplish the task of the higher headquarters.  Decisive operations conclusively determine the outcome of major operations, battles, and engagements.

Decisive Point:  A geographic place, specific key event, critical factor, or function that, when acted upon allows commanders to gain a marked advantage over an adversary or contribute materially to achieving success. 

Endstate:  Conditions that, when achieved, accomplish the mission.                                                                                                   


COA Development
Decisive Point
A geographic place:  (TERRAIN BASED) Focused on the seizure, retention, control, occupation, or denial of a specified piece of terrain that greatly influences the outcome.

A Key Event:  (TIME BASED) Focused on causing events to occur at or within a specific time that greatly influences the outcome.

An Enabling System:  (ENEMY BASED) Focused on the destruction, incapacitation, seizure, attrition, clearance, or neutralization of an enemy force, unit, capability that greatly influences the outcome.  

Your decisive point will usually accomplish one of these three.

What do you think the Decisive Point should be?  

Why is it decisive?  

Who will accomplish the DP?


1. DP is the destruction/neutralization of the tanks
2. The tanks are the primary threat to success of the operation and neutralizing the tanks will provide a marked advantage to achieving the mission
3. 1st Squad preventing enemy from making it to the tank shed

COA Development
Analyze Relative Combat Power
Compares most significant strengths and weakness of each force. 
Gives insight into-
Enemy weaknesses to exploit
Friendly strengths to exploit enemy weaknesses
Enemy strengths to mitigate
Friendly weaknesses to protect
Look at ENY & Terrain Analysis –YOU ALREADY DID THE WORK!
They have fortified bunkers in open fields
We could conduct an attack OR we destroy it with a Javelin 
Technique:
Determine force ratios (ex: Historical planning ratio attacker-to-defender for an attack of a fortified position is 3:1)


COA Development
Generate Options
As a platoon leader how many options do you think you will develop?
How do we generate options?
Look at the doctrinal aspects of how to accomplish the mission
Wargame with your subordinates, peers, commander
Think outside the box/adhere to the Principles of War
Analyze past operations and their success or failure
Designate the decisive operation (DO) and all shaping operations (SO) and determine their purpose first, then which tactical task will best achieve that purpose.
The essential tasks your DO & SOs are designated must mass the effects of overwhelming combat power at your decisive point.

COA Statement

The Purpose of this operation is to allow the unhindered passage of the Battalion Decisive Operation to OBJ HAMMER.

Decisive to the operation is the seizure of OBJ SAW East.  This is decisive because it will prevent direct or observed indirect fires from being placed on C/2-327, the BN DO.

We will accomplish this by conducting an envelopment. 




COA Development
COA Statement continued

We will assume tactical risk by moving near the OBJ across open terrain.

We will mitigate this risk with IDF suppression and obscuration vic. of the OBJ.

Endstate:  Tactical Obstacles on OBJ SAW Reduced.  Enemy unable to place direct or observed indirect fires on C/2-327.  C/2-327 passed through our AO.  Company postured in PLT BPs, prepared to defeat enemy CATK from the East.


COA Development
Remaining Considerations 

How will you support your COA? (Sustainment paragraph of the OPORD)
What supplies do you need to ensure mission success? (Only brief what is relevant.)
How will you handle personnel issues (if relevant to your level of operation) and how will you handle enemy personnel you have captured.
CASEVAC/MEDEVAC PLAN?
What will you do if you take a casualty? 
Where are your Casualty Collection Points? 
Where are the HLZs (Helicopter Landing Zones) or AXPs (Ambulance Exchange Points)?
Briefly go over sustainment paragraph, it will be covered in OPORD.

COA Development
Remaining Considerations continued

How will you control and coordinate your COA? (Command and Signal)
Where are key leaders within your element and higher located for each phase of the operation. (Important if your PACE plan incorporates a runner to send information.)
How will you communicate? 
Within your element
To higher
To neighboring units


Briefly go over Command and Signal, it will be briefed in depth in OPORD.
