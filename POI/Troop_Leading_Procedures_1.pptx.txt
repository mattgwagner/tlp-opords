Troop leading procedures are a dynamic process used by small-unit leaders to analyze a mission, develop a plan, and prepare for an operation (ADP 5-0). These procedures enable leaders to maximize available planning time while developing effective plans and preparing their units for an operation. (See paragraphs 10-10 to 10-41 for a discussion on the eight steps of TLP.)  -FM 6-0, p. 10-2 (2014)

Receive a mission alert in the form of a Combat Order
Warning Order (WARNORD) – Quick brief on general situation/mission to start planning.
Operations Order (OPORD) – Primary brief with in-depth and thorough plan on how to execute mission.
Fragmentary Order (FRAGORD) – This is how changes to the OPORD are briefed.
Initiates the planning and preparation process so the platoon leader can prepare an initial WARNORD as quickly as possible. 
Can be delivered Written, Verbal, or Electronic.

Step 1: Receive the Mission

Leader uses no more than 1/3 of available time for planning, preparation and issuing OPORD.
Subordinates get 2/3 of available time to plan and prepare for operation.
Use backwards planning to schedule preparation time.

Leaders determine their units’ missions and assess the time available to accomplish them.

Conduct an initial (light) analysis of the Order using METT-TC, mission variables, which will be referred to as TMTCET.

Continue to conduct analysis as new information is received.

Deduce tentative mission if one was not received.

Step 1: Receive the Mission
Explain FM 6-0, Chapter 10, Section 13 states “The order and detail in which leaders analyze the factors of METT-TC is flexible. “

Mission Variables describe the characteristics of the area of operation, focusing on how they might affect a mission. Incorporating the analysis of the operational variables into TMTCET ensures Army Leaders consider the best available relevant information about conditions that pertain to the mission.

TMTCET It is a logical process/order to analyze mission variables when making a tentative plan. First understanding our Time and Mission helps us to frame our planning. Then we analyze Terrain, Civil Considerations, and Enemy next because that is the order it is analyzed in Information Preparation of the Battlefield (ATP 2-01.3). We conduct a detailed analysis of Troops Available last because it transitions us into AGADAP. Cursory analysis of other mission variables will sometimes happen concurrently, such as Time and Mission or AO/AI being placed into Terrain.  The order of mission variables into TMTCET is how we will analyze mission variables when we are learning how to build OPORDERs. THIS IS A WAY.

Note: Backwards planning of time is one of the first things we do when receiving the mission in step 1 of the TLP process, understanding how much time we have determines how we dive into analyzing/planning everything else.

Analysis of Mission
Outcome
What is a Mission?
A task and purpose that clearly indicates the action to be taken and the reason for the action
Task
A clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by Soldiers or units. 
Essential Task – Must be done in order to accomplish the mission
Specified Tasks – Specifically given to you by your commander
Implied Tasks – Must be performed to accomplish a specified task 
The result of mission analysis is the restated mission statement.

Mission
Doctrinal Tasks
Task and Purpose: 
FM 3-90-1, Appendix B
“The tactical mission tasks in this appendix describe the results or effects the commander wants to achieve—the what and why of a mission statement not previously addressed in this publication. A mission statement contains the who, what, when, where, and why associated with a specific operation. The what and why of a mission statement are not the same thing and both are needed. The what is an effect that is normally measurable. The why of a mission statement provides the mission’s purpose. These tasks have specific military definitions that are different from those found in a dictionary. In some cases, the discussion includes more than just a definition; it includes results or effects in relation to the enemy, terrain, or friendly forces not associated with any specific type or form of an operation. Tasks that identify a friendly action rarely provide sufficient clarity for a mission statement. 
A tactical mission task is the specific activity performed by a unit while executing a form of tactical operation or form of maneuver. It may be expressed in terms of either actions by a friendly force or effects on an enemy force.”

Terrain & Weather Analysis
Area of Operation (AO) – Higher commanders use boundaries to define their platoons’ and companies' areas of operations. Assigning areas of operations to subordinates lets the subordinates use their initiative and supports decentralized execution.
	“What do I own?” 
Area of Interest (AI) – An area of interest is a geographical area, usually larger than the leader's area of operation. The area of interest includes threat forces or other elements characterizing the operational environment and greatly influencing the accomplishment of the mission.
	“What can affect me?”

General location of operation
Initial operational timeline
Reconnaissance to initiate
Movement to initiate
Planning and preparation instructions

Step 3: Make a Tentative Plan
Mission analysis is conducted through the analysis of mission variables. This analysis drives COA Development in the form of AGADAP.

Instructor Note: COA Analysis is done to ensure the plan meets the COA Screening Criteria that will be discussed in the next block of instruction. We are just letting the candidate know steps 4 and 5 exist, not diving in depth. Do not need to dive into types of COA Analysis war-game later, it will detract from learning the basics.

This step can occur at any point during the TLPs
Can be conducted by subordinate leaders
Includes movement to positions closer to LD, initial inspections, reconnaissance, battle drill rehearsals,  or SOP items
If the reconnaissance reveals a change in the situation, the plan must be adjusted accordingly.

Step 4: Initiate Movement

Reconnaissance is used to confirm or deny the assumptions we made during the planning process. 
Situation and time available dictate the type and detail of reconnaissance
Map, terrain model, aerial photo, ground

Plan and conduct a leader’s reconnaissance for every mission.

Consider risk inherent in moving forward of friendly lines, or into unoccupied area. Avoid detection.

If reconnaissance reveals a change to the situation you must modify your plan.

Rehearsing reconnaissance plan will mitigate risk.

Step 5: Conduct Reconnaissance

Develop OPORD based on tentative plan, reconnaissance and additional guidance. 
Review plan to ensure that the Commander’s mission and intent is satisfied.
Prepare overlays, indirect fire list, complete sustainment and mission command requirements.
Use five paragraph format and common tactical language from ATP 3-21.8 (Ch. 5) and ADRP 5-0.
Prepare the briefing site, medium, and material needed to brief subordinates.

Can be issued either orally or written 
Issue while observing the combat area if possible 
Supplements to OPORDs:
 Terrain models
 Sand Table 
 Map boards/Overlays 
 Sketches
 Fire Support Matrix
The OPORD must precisely and concisely explain the mission, commanders intent, and concept of the operation. 
Conduct confirmation brief.




If there is a section of the OPORD format that has no significant conclusions or effect on your mission, don’t brief it.  
In terms of evaluation, safer to say, “Nothing significant.”

Have Clarity
Are Complete and Brief
Are Timely
Allow Initiative by recognizing subordinates freedom of action within the PLs concept
Use affirmative form and are authoritative

Cut out excess information that does not apply to your AO or add to the situational awareness of adjacent unit missions.

Rehearsals
 The leader uses rehearsals to
Practice essential tasks (improve performance). 
Reveal weaknesses or problems in the plan. 
Coordinate the actions of subordinate elements. Improve soldier understanding of the concept of the operation (foster confidence in soldiers). 

Rehearsals Must
Be habitual during training in order to effectively employ units tactically.  
Clarify the Commander’s intent.
Reinforce scheme of maneuver.
Ensure understanding and instill confidence in participants.
Provide feedback and expose problems in the plan.
