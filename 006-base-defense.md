> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Higher | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Night Iterations - Coaching Focus)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to establish and maintain a defensive perimeter around FOB THUNDER to prevent REAPER infiltration, protect critical assets, and maintain security of the forward operating base.
>
> **Destination:** FOB THUNDER, located at MP 0610 1550, AO HERRERA (MOUT site).
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will establish defensive positions, assign sectors of fire, establish early warning systems, conduct security patrols, and respond to enemy threats. Defensive positions will be occupied and maintained for the duration of the operation.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD is ideal for night training iterations due to static operations. Candidates focus on defensive planning, sector sketches, early warning, and QRF employment without the added complexity of offensive maneuver under limited visibility.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Simulate enemy reconnaissance probes or infiltration attempts.
> - Introduce time-sensitive intelligence about potential enemy attack.
> - Test response to indirect fire, IEDs, or enemy activity.
> - Use civilian role-players approaching the FOB to test ROE and decision-making.
> - Inject equipment failures, casualties, or communication disruptions.
> - Test ability to maintain security while conducting routine operations.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. FOB THUNDER is located at MP 0610 1550 within the MOUT training area (AO HERRERA), surrounded by urban terrain and limited open areas.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** FOB THUNDER is situated in an urban environment with multiple buildings, narrow streets, and limited open spaces. The surrounding area includes adjacent buildings, alleys, and potential enemy approach routes. Urban terrain provides numerous positions for both defense and enemy infiltration. Buildings offer observation points and fields of fire, while underground routes and alleys may be used by enemy forces. Limited vehicle access due to urban constraints.

   - **Key Terrain:** FOB THUNDER itself is the decisive terrain. Adjacent buildings and intersections provide observation and fields of fire for defensive positions. Main roads and alleys are likely avenues of approach for enemy forces. High ground (rooftops) offers observation advantages.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are an irregular force capable of conducting reconnaissance, infiltration, and attacks against friendly positions. They are experienced in urban operations and may employ small arms, IEDs, and indirect fire. They are capable of blending with the local populace and using urban terrain for concealment and approach.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 6-10 REAPER personnel, small arms, possible RPG/HMG, IEDs, and communications equipment.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are likely operating in the surrounding urban area, conducting reconnaissance and seeking opportunities to infiltrate or attack the FOB. They may establish observation posts or use civilians to gather intelligence. Exact locations unknown.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces conduct reconnaissance of the FOB perimeter, attempt limited infiltration or probing attacks, and may employ indirect fire or IEDs to harass friendly forces. They avoid decisive engagement but seek to gather intelligence and disrupt operations.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces launch a coordinated attack with multiple elements, using infiltration, indirect fire, and IEDs to breach the perimeter and attack critical assets. REAPER forces attempt to overrun defensive positions or cause significant casualties before withdrawing.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company establishes and maintains security of FOB THUNDER to protect critical assets and enable continued operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Maintain a secure perimeter, prevent enemy infiltration, and protect critical assets to ensure FOB THUNDER remains operational and secure.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians are present in the surrounding urban area. Defensive operations must minimize risk to non-combatants, avoid collateral damage, and maintain positive relations with local populace while ensuring base security.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.
