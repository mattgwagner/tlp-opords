**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #002 / CODE NAME: "MOVEMENT TO CONTACT"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Moderate | **Recommended Phase:** WALK (Blocks 3-4), RUN (Day Iterations)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact in AO FLUNKER with squads operating independently in assigned zones to locate, engage, and assess REAPER forces. Each squad has its own objective and operates at its own pace.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD is designed to evaluate **individual squad leader planning and decision-making**. The PL issues the platoon OPORD, but each squad leader must conduct their own TLP — analyzing terrain, selecting movement techniques, choosing formations, planning actions on contact, and issuing a squad OPORD. Cadre should assign one evaluator per squad to observe the SL's planning process and tactical decisions.
>
> **Destinations:**
> - 1st Squad → OBJ RIVERA (vic MP 0600 1538)
> - 2nd Squad → OBJ HERRERA (vic MP 0612 1546)
> - 3rd Squad → OBJ SANTOS (vic MP 0613 1532)
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Each squad independently locates and engages REAPER in its zone, secures its objective, and reports. Squads do not depend on or wait for adjacent squads.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Deploy one OPFOR team (2-3 personnel) per zone, positioned near each squad's objective.
> - Each OPFOR team operates independently — do not coordinate across zones unless running MDCOA.
> - Introduce a civilian or non-combatant scenario in one zone to test ROE.
> - Cadre can inject intelligence updates, obstacles, or simulate equipment malfunctions per zone.
> - Vary OPFOR tactics across zones (one team delays, one ambushes, one defends) to create distinct planning problems for each SL.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.
>
> **See Also:** [LTA Grid Reference](lta-grid-reference.md)

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO FLUNKER includes the road junction at OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546), bounded to the north by the old logging road, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the creek line, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The road junction near OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546) controls access to the eastern sector. The Bradenton Ave corridor in the western sector provides a north-south avenue of approach. Conex City (vic MP 0613 1532) offers concealment and defensive positions in the eastern sector. Woodlines throughout the AO provide covered and concealed movement. Dense vegetation limits observation to under 50 meters off road corridors.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are a small, organized group of irregular fighters, likely part of a local militia or insurgent cell. They are familiar with the terrain, use small arms and support weapons, and employ ambush and hit-and-run tactics. They are capable of blending into the local populace and adapting quickly to changing situations.

**1. Composition.** Three independent REAPER teams, each 2-3 combatants with small arms and a possible crew-served weapon. Total 6-9 combatants distributed across AO FLUNKER.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER teams are dispersed across the AO, with one team operating in each sector:
   - Western team: vic OBJ RIVERA (MP 0600 1538), using the Bradenton Ave intersection and surrounding woodlines for concealment.
   - Central team: vic OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546), using the road junction and vegetation for observation and defense.
   - Eastern team: vic OBJ SANTOS (MP 0613 1532), using the structures and concealment in and around Conex City.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** Each REAPER team initiates harassing fire from concealed positions when friendly forces enter its area, then breaks contact to avoid being fixed. Teams may leave behind simple obstacles or early warning devices but do not attempt to decisively engage. Each team fights independently without reinforcement from adjacent teams.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER teams coordinate across sectors to mass against one friendly squad, concentrating fires from multiple directions. The isolated squad faces a coordinated ambush while adjacent squads are unaware or too distant to provide immediate support.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company locates and engages REAPER forces to assess strength and disposition.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Locate REAPER forces and establish tactical advantage for future operations.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians present; avoid unnecessary disturbances and ensure safety.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact in AO FLUNKER NLT ____ to locate and engage REAPER forces in assigned squad zones and assess their strength and disposition.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Develop the situation with REAPER forces across AO FLUNKER to enable the company commander to make informed decisions for follow-on operations.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Each squad locates REAPER forces in its assigned zone and reports their strength and disposition. (2) Fix or destroy REAPER forces upon contact. (3) Squads maintain freedom to maneuver independently throughout the engagement.

**End State:** REAPER forces located and assessed in all three zones, squad objectives secured, friendly forces maintaining tactical advantage and prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact across three independent squad zones in AO FLUNKER. Each squad advances toward its own objective at its own pace, locating and engaging REAPER forces within its assigned zone. No main effort is designated — all squads operate with equal priority. Squad leaders select their own movement techniques, formations, and routes based on their analysis of terrain and enemy situation. The PL monitors all squads and coordinates as needed. The PSG trails, prepared to support any squad requiring reinforcement or casualty evacuation.

### c. Scheme of Fires
No priority of indirect fires designated. Mortar support available through company on request; any squad may request fires through the PL.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Western Zone):**

- **TASK:** Conduct a movement to contact in the western zone of AO FLUNKER toward OBJ RIVERA (MP 0600 1538). Move north from the assembly area along or west of the Bradenton Ave corridor. Locate and engage REAPER forces in the vicinity of the road intersection at OBJ RIVERA. Secure the objective and establish a hasty defensive position oriented north and west. Report enemy strength and disposition.
- **PURPOSE:** Clear the western approaches to deny REAPER use of the Bradenton Ave corridor for reinforcement or withdrawal.

**2. 2nd Squad (Central Zone):**

- **TASK:** Conduct a movement to contact in the central zone of AO FLUNKER toward OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546). Move north from the assembly area through the wooded area between the Bradenton corridor and Conex City. Locate and engage REAPER forces in the vicinity of the road junction at OBJ HERRERA. Secure the objective and establish a hasty defensive position oriented north. Report enemy strength and disposition.
- **PURPOSE:** Develop the situation at the road junction to enable the company commander to control the central avenue of approach for follow-on operations.

**3. 3rd Squad (Eastern Zone):**

- **TASK:** Conduct a movement to contact in the eastern zone of AO FLUNKER toward OBJ SANTOS (MP 0613 1532). Move north from the assembly area toward Conex City. Locate and engage REAPER forces in and around the structures at OBJ SANTOS. Secure the objective and establish a hasty defensive position oriented north and east. Report enemy strength and disposition.
- **PURPOSE:** Clear the eastern sector to prevent REAPER from using the built-up area as a defensive strongpoint or staging area.

**4. Platoon Leader:**

- **TASK:** Monitor and coordinate all three squads during independent zone operations. Position to maintain communications with all elements. Provide guidance and allocate supporting fires as the situation develops.
