## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO FLUNKER includes the road junction at OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546), bounded to the north by the old logging road, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the creek line, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The road junction near OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546) is critical for controlling access to the area and is a likely point of enemy contact. Woodlines along the approach routes provide covered and concealed movement for the platoon. A small rise east of the objective offers observation and a potential support-by-fire position. A concealed route to the south enables maneuver or withdrawal if needed.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are a small, organized group of irregular fighters, likely part of a local militia or insurgent cell. They are familiar with the terrain, use small arms and support weapons, and employ ambush and hit-and-run tactics. They are capable of blending into the local populace and adapting quickly to changing situations.

**1. Composition.** 6-8 REAPER combatants, small arms, possible HMG/RPG, in concealment.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are generally dispersed in concealed positions throughout the area, using terrain and vegetation for cover. They maintain flexibility to regroup or withdraw and are likely to observe friendly movements from hidden vantage points.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** Upon contact, REAPER forces initiate harassing fire from covered positions, then quickly break contact to avoid being fixed or destroyed. They may leave behind simple obstacles or IEDs to slow pursuit, but do not attempt to decisively engage or encircle the platoon.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces initiate a complex ambush using multiple firing positions and IEDs, attempting to fix the platoon in a kill zone. They coordinate with additional elements to reinforce the engagement, seeking to encircle and destroy the platoon or inflict heavy casualties before friendly forces can maneuver out of the ambush.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company locates and engages REAPER forces to assess strength and disposition.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Locate REAPER forces and establish tactical advantage for future operations.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians present; avoid unnecessary disturbances and ensure safety.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact in AO FLUNKER NLT ____ to locate and engage REAPER forces and assess their strength and disposition.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Develop the situation with REAPER forces in AO FLUNKER to enable the company commander to make informed decisions for follow-on operations.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Locate REAPER forces and determine their strength and disposition. (2) Fix or destroy REAPER forces upon contact. (3) Maintain freedom to maneuver throughout the engagement.

**End State:** REAPER forces located and engaged, their strength and disposition assessed and reported, friendly forces maintaining tactical advantage and prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact toward OBJ HERRERA using bounding overwatch. Two squads advance as the main body, alternating bounds to maintain security. The reserve element trails, prepared to reinforce the squad in contact, exploit success, or respond to counterattack. Upon contact, the platoon develops the situation — fixing the enemy with the element in contact while maneuvering the uncommitted element to a position of advantage.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Squad has priority of indirect fires. Mortar support available through company on request.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Lead Element — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Lead the movement to contact toward OBJ HERRERA (MP 0612 1546) using covered and concealed routes. Establish contact with REAPER forces, fix the enemy, and report size, activity, location, and weapons. Be prepared to assault through on order or support 2nd Squad's maneuver.
- **PURPOSE:** Make initial contact and fix REAPER so the platoon can develop the situation and maneuver against a known enemy position.

**2. 2nd Squad (Trail/Overwatch Element — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Provide overwatch during 1st Squad's bounds. Upon 1st Squad's contact, maneuver to a position of advantage to support by fire or assault through as directed by the PL. Report REAPER activity and positions observed during overwatch.
- **PURPOSE:** Enable the platoon to gain and maintain contact from a position of advantage, preventing REAPER from isolating or overwhelming the lead element.

**3. 3rd Squad (Reserve):**

- **TASK:** Trail the main body at a distance that allows rapid commitment. Be prepared to reinforce the squad in contact, exploit a penetration, or establish a blocking position to prevent REAPER withdrawal. Commit only on the PL's order.
- **PURPOSE:** Provide the PL flexibility to exploit success or respond to unexpected REAPER action without committing the overwatch element.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only confirmed enemy combatants posing a threat.
   2. Use graduated response appropriate to the threat.
   3. Avoid civilian engagement and minimize collateral damage.
   4. Report civilian casualties immediately.

**2. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR):**
   1. Confirm REAPER personnel and weapons.
   2. Identify fortifications and defensive positions.
   3. Monitor REAPER patrols and movement.
   4. Assess civilian presence in the area of operations.

**3. Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR):**
   1. Initial contact with REAPER forces — report size, activity, location, and weapons immediately
   2. Loss of communication with any squad for more than 10 minutes during movement
   3. Friendly casualty rendering any squad combat ineffective
   4. Unexpected obstacle or IED blocking the primary avenue of approach

**4. Reporting:**
   - **Report to higher when SP'ing or crossing the line of departure.**
   - **In Position Report:** Upon occupying the ORP or objective.
   - **LACE Report:** At end of each movement phase.
   - **SALUTE Report:** Upon contact with enemy or relevant activity.

**5.** This OPORD is effective immediately upon distribution.
