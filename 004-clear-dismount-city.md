**THIS IS A TRAINING OPERATION ORDER. FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**

**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #004 / CODE NAME: "CLEAR DISMOUNT CITY"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> Mission Summary: 1st Platoon is tasked to clear, seize, and secure the urban terrain known as OBJ FLUNKER. The enemy is using this area as a base for operations. The platoon must occupy the city and prevent the enemy from regaining control or using it for future operations.
>
> Destination: OBJ FLUNKER, AO HERRERA (urban terrain, grid MP 0620 1560).
>
> Actions on Objective: Platoon will establish an ORP, move to the city, isolate the objective, clear buildings and key terrain, secure the area, and establish defensive positions to prevent enemy re-infiltration. Assault, support, and security elements will be employed per doctrine.
>
> OPFOR/Training Wrinkles: OPFOR should simulate a determined defense using urban tactics, barricades, and possible IEDs. Consider introducing non-combatant role-players, civilian presence, or hostages to test ROE and decision-making. OPFOR may attempt to counterattack, infiltrate, or use underground routes. Cadre can inject time-sensitive intelligence, simulate booby traps, or introduce unexpected obstacles to challenge the platoon's planning and execution.
>
> UAS/Counter-UAS Injects: Simulate enemy use of a small UAS (drone) for reconnaissance prior to or during the operation. Use a drone or cadre observer to replicate aerial surveillance and force candidates to react to detection. Introduce a scenario where the enemy uses a drone to spot and adjust indirect fire or coordinate a counterattack. Have OPFOR use a drone to identify friendly positions, forcing candidates to use camouflage, concealment, and movement discipline. Simulate electronic warfare or jamming as a result of enemy UAS activity, impacting friendly communications or GPS. Allow candidates to detect and report a UAS, rewarding units that take effective countermeasures (e.g., moving under cover, halting movement, or changing routes). Use a drone to simulate dropping a small munition or marking a target for indirect fire, testing the unit’s response to aerial threats.

**1. SITUATION.**

a. Area of Interest. Northeast Florida, Clay County in the vicinity of AO HERRERA. 

b. Area of Operations.

1. Terrain. OBJ FLUNKER is a small urban area with multiple multi-story buildings, narrow streets, alleys, and limited open spaces. The city is surrounded by wooded areas and open fields. Urban terrain provides numerous positions for defense, ambush, and concealment. Buildings offer cover and observation points, while underground routes (sewers, basements) may be used for movement or escape. Limited vehicle access due to debris and barricades.

   a. Key Terrain: Central plaza (MP 0620 1560), police station, and high-rise building dominate OBJ FLUNKER and are critical for control. Rooftops and intersections provide observation and fields of fire. Main roads and alleyways are likely avenues of approach and withdrawal.

2. Weather. Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

c. Enemy Forces. The enemy is a well-armed irregular force, using OBJ FLUNKER as a base for operations. They are experienced in urban combat, employ barricades, IEDs, and may use civilians as shields. Capable of rapid movement through buildings and underground routes. Recent conflicts have demonstrated the widespread use of UAS (drones) for reconnaissance and attack. Enemy and irregular forces may employ commercial or military drones for surveillance, target acquisition, or direct attack. Platoon leaders and squads must account for potential UAS threats during planning, movement, and actions on the objective. Maintain vigilance for aerial threats, use available cover and concealment, and report any UAS sightings immediately.

1. Composition. 8-10 combatants, small arms, possible HMG/RPG, IEDs, barricades, and communications equipment.

2. Disposition. Enemy forces are dispersed in defensive positions throughout the city, occupying key buildings and intersections. They maintain observation on likely approaches and are prepared to reinforce or withdraw as needed. Possible use of lookouts and early warning systems.

3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA). Enemy defends key buildings and intersections, using small arms and IEDs to delay friendly advance. If overwhelmed, they withdraw through underground routes or blend with civilians, attempting to regroup outside the city.

4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA). Enemy launches a coordinated counterattack with reinforcements, using pre-placed IEDs, barricades, and snipers to inflict maximum casualties. They attempt to encircle friendly forces or use hostages to delay operations. The enemy uses a UAS to identify friendly positions, adjust indirect fire, or direct the counterattack.

d. Friendly Forces.

1. Higher Headquarters: A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

2. Mission. A Company clears and secures OBJ FLUNKER to deny the enemy a base of operations and enable follow-on operations in AO Starke.

3. Commander's Intent. Seize and secure OBJ FLUNKER, eliminate enemy presence, and establish a defensive posture to prevent enemy re-infiltration.

e. Civil Considerations. Civilians are present in the city. Minimize risk to non-combatants, avoid collateral damage, and maintain positive relations with local populace.

f. Attachments and Detachments. None.

**2. MISSION.**

1st Platoon clears, seizes, and secures OBJ FLUNKER (MP 0620 1560) NLT ____ to eliminate enemy forces, deny the enemy a base of operations, and enable occupation by friendly forces.

**3. EXECUTION.**

a. Concept of Operations. 1st Platoon establishes an ORP, moves to OBJ FLUNKER, and isolates the objective. 1st Squad serves as the assault element, clearing buildings and key terrain. 2nd Squad acts as the support element, providing suppressive fire and isolating the objective area. 3rd Squad serves as the security element, securing flanks, rear, and preventing enemy reinforcement or escape. Upon completion, the platoon consolidates and establishes defensive positions to hold the city.

b. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver.

- Squads SP from platoon ORP in squad column.
- 1st Squad clears buildings along the main axis; 2nd Squad provides overwatch and suppressive fire from key intersections and rooftops; 3rd Squad secures flanks, rear, and blocks likely enemy withdrawal or reinforcement routes.
- Platoon advances by phase lines, clearing and securing each sector before moving forward.

c. Scheme of Fires. 1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has been allocated two mortar targets for planning: DC001 and DC002. 2nd Squad has priority for 81mm HE mortars on order. Use smoke to screen movement as needed.
