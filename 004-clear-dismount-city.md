## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** OBJ FLUNKER is a small urban area with multiple multi-story buildings, narrow streets, alleys, and limited open spaces. The city is surrounded by wooded areas and open fields. Urban terrain provides numerous positions for defense, ambush, and concealment. Buildings offer cover and observation points, while underground routes (sewers, basements) may be used for movement or escape. Limited vehicle access due to debris and barricades.

   - **Key Terrain:** Central plaza (MP 0620 1560), police station, and high-rise building dominate OBJ FLUNKER and are critical for control. Rooftops and intersections provide observation and fields of fire. Main roads and alleyways are likely avenues of approach and withdrawal.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are a well-armed irregular force, using OBJ FLUNKER as a base for operations. They are experienced in urban combat, employ barricades, IEDs, and may use civilians as shields. Capable of rapid movement through buildings and underground routes.

**1. Composition.** 8-10 REAPER combatants, small arms, possible HMG/RPG, IEDs, barricades, and communications equipment.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are dispersed in defensive positions throughout the city, occupying key buildings and intersections. They maintain observation on likely approaches and are prepared to reinforce or withdraw as needed. Possible use of lookouts and early warning systems.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces defend key buildings and intersections, using small arms and IEDs to delay friendly advance. If overwhelmed, they withdraw through underground routes or blend with civilians, attempting to regroup outside the city.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces launch a coordinated counterattack with reinforcements, using pre-placed IEDs, barricades, and snipers to inflict maximum casualties. They attempt to encircle friendly forces or use hostages to delay operations.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company clears and secures OBJ FLUNKER to deny REAPER a base of operations and enable follow-on operations in AO Starke.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Seize and secure OBJ FLUNKER, eliminate REAPER presence, and establish a defensive posture to prevent REAPER re-infiltration.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians are present in the city. Minimize risk to non-combatants, avoid collateral damage, and maintain positive relations with local populace.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.
