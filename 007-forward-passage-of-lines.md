>
> **Complexity:** Highest | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Advanced Iterations - Second Cycle or High Performers)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to conduct a forward passage of lines through 2nd Platoon's defensive positions to continue offensive operations against REAPER forces.
>
> **Destination:** Passage point at MP 0607 1555, AO HERRERA (MOUT site). Continue movement to OBJ THUNDER (MP 0602 1565) after passage.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will coordinate with 2nd Platoon, move through the passage point, maintain security during passage, and continue movement to the objective. Critical coordination required to avoid fratricide and maintain operational tempo.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD has the highest complexity due to inter-unit coordination requirements. Recommend for second cycle iterations or candidates demonstrating strong TLP proficiency. Requires detailed coordination, timing, and communication to avoid fratricide.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Simulate coordination challenges with the stationary unit (2nd Platoon).
> - Introduce time pressure or changes to passage timeline.
> - Test ability to maintain security during passage.
> - Use enemy contact during or immediately after passage to test response.
> - Inject communication difficulties or coordination problems.
> - Test ability to maintain formation and control during passage.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO HERRERA includes the MOUT training area with passage point at MP 0607 1555 and objective at OBJ THUNDER (MP 0602 1565).

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The passage point is located in an urban environment with buildings, streets, and limited open areas. The route from passage point to objective includes urban terrain with potential enemy positions. Urban terrain provides cover and concealment but also limits observation and fields of fire. Buildings and alleys may be used by enemy forces to observe or engage friendly forces during passage.

   - **Key Terrain:** The passage point at MP 0607 1555 is critical for safe passage. OBJ THUNDER (MP 0602 1565) is the objective for follow-on operations. Buildings along the route provide observation points and potential enemy positions.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are an irregular force operating in the urban area. They are capable of observing friendly movements and may attempt to engage friendly forces during or after passage. They employ small arms, possible support weapons, and may use IEDs.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 4-6 REAPER personnel, small arms, possible RPG/HMG, IEDs, in defensive or observation positions.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are likely positioned in buildings or observation posts along the route of advance, monitoring friendly movements and prepared to engage if opportunity presents. They may attempt to engage during passage or immediately after.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces observe friendly passage but do not engage decisively, preferring to maintain observation and report friendly movements. They may employ limited harassing fire or IEDs but avoid decisive engagement.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces launch a coordinated attack during or immediately after passage, using indirect fire, IEDs, and small arms to disrupt friendly movement and inflict casualties. They attempt to fix friendly forces at the passage point or along the route of advance.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts forward passage of lines to continue offensive operations and seize OBJ THUNDER.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Safely pass through 2nd Platoon's positions, maintain operational tempo, and continue movement to objective to maintain pressure on REAPER forces.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians may be present in the urban area. Passage operations must minimize risk to non-combatants and avoid collateral damage while maintaining security and operational tempo.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts a forward passage of lines through 2nd Platoon's defensive positions at MP 0607 1555 NLT ____, then continues movement to OBJ THUNDER (MP 0602 1565) to continue offensive operations against REAPER forces.

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**1. Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon safely passes through 2nd Platoon's positions and continues movement to OBJ THUNDER to maintain operational tempo and pressure on REAPER forces.

**2. Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to conduct a forward passage of lines to continue offensive operations and seize OBJ THUNDER, maintaining pressure on REAPER forces.

**3. End State.** 1st Platoon successfully passes through 2nd Platoon's positions, continues movement to OBJ THUNDER, and maintains operational tempo to continue offensive operations against REAPER forces.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon coordinates with 2nd Platoon to conduct a forward passage of lines. The platoon moves to the passage point, coordinates passage procedures, and moves through 2nd Platoon's positions while maintaining security and formation. Upon completion of passage, the platoon continues movement to OBJ THUNDER, maintaining security and operational tempo. The platoon is prepared to respond to enemy contact during or after passage.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Squads move from assembly area to passage point using covered and concealed routes.
- Passage conducted in designated order with coordination between units.
- Security maintained during passage to prevent enemy interference.
- Upon completion of passage, platoon continues movement to objective maintaining formation and security.

### d. Scheme of Fires
