# FLX Inject Cards - User Guide

## Overview
This inject card system allows cadre to quickly vary OPORD iterations during Field Training Exercises (FLX) without requiring new OPORDs. Each iteration can be made unique by applying 1-3 injects from different categories.

## How to Use

### Basic Process
1. **Select Base OPORD** - Choose which OPORD to use (001-008)
2. **Choose 1-3 Inject Cards** - Select from different categories to create variation
3. **Apply During TLP or Execution** - Provide injects at appropriate times
4. **Document Which Injects Used** - Track for AAR and to avoid repetition

### When to Apply Injects

**During TLP (Troop Leading Procedures):**
- Situation Update Cards
- Friendly Force Status Cards
- Timeline Pressure Cards
- Weather/Terrain Cards (if affecting planning)

**During Execution:**
- Enemy Behavior Cards
- Civilian Scenario Cards
- Weather/Terrain Cards (if dynamic)
- Additional Situation Updates

### Recommended Combinations

**Simple Variation (1 inject):**
- One Situation Update OR
- One Enemy Behavior Card OR
- One Friendly Force Status Card

**Moderate Variation (2 injects):**
- Situation Update + Enemy Behavior
- Friendly Force Status + Timeline Pressure
- Weather/Terrain + Civilian Scenario

**Complex Variation (3 injects):**
- Situation Update + Enemy Behavior + Friendly Force Status
- Weather/Terrain + Timeline Pressure + Civilian Scenario

## Inject Card Categories

1. **Situation Update Cards** - Intelligence updates that change the tactical problem
2. **Enemy Behavior Cards** - Variations in REAPER actions and reactions
3. **Friendly Force Status Cards** - Changes to friendly unit conditions
4. **Weather/Terrain Cards** - Environmental condition changes
5. **Civilian Scenario Cards** - ROE and decision-making challenges
6. **Timeline Pressure Cards** - Time constraint variations

## Tips for Cadre

- **Don't Overload:** 1-3 injects per iteration is usually sufficient
- **Mix Categories:** Avoid using multiple injects from the same category
- **Track Usage:** Keep a simple log to avoid repeating the same combination
- **Match Complexity:** Use simpler injects for early iterations, more complex for later ones
- **Be Flexible:** Adjust inject timing based on candidate performance and learning objectives
