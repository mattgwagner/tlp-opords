## Section 1: References and Authority

This training package is developed in accordance with the following publications:

| Reference | Title |
|-----------|-------|
| ATP 5-0.1 | Commander and Staff Officer Guide |
| ADP 5-0 | The Operations Process |
| ATP 3-21.8 | Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad |
| CMP | ARNG OCS Course Management Plan, 1 JAN 2024 |
| ISAP | ARNG OCS Individual Student Assessment Plan, 1 JAN 2024 |
| Platoon Trainer Guide | 15 November 2024 |
| 211th Regiment OCSOP | 1 OCT 2024 |

### Purpose

This training package provides a systematic approach to teaching **Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs)** using the Crawl-Walk-Run methodology. The purpose is to develop officer candidates' ability to receive, analyze, plan, and execute tactical missions through demonstrated proficiency in the eight TLP steps.

### Evaluation Standard

Per ISAP Section 2-5(c): Platoon trainers will evaluate the candidate's use and understanding of the troop leading procedures during the Field Leadership Exercise (FLX) II in a one hour and forty-five-minute scenario. The candidate must receive an **"E"** or **"S"** on the Field Leadership Evaluation Report (FLER).

---

## Section 2: The Eight Troop Leading Procedures

Per OCSOP B-11, TLPs provide a format to follow in any leadership situation. As the leader gains experience, the leader will employ the TLPs automatically with little thought given to the actual steps.

| Step | Procedure |
|:----:|-----------|
| 1 | Receive the Mission |
| 2 | Issue a Warning Order |
| 3 | Make a Tentative Plan |
| 4 | Initiate Movement |
| 5 | Conduct Reconnaissance |
| 6 | Complete the Plan |
| 7 | Issue the Order |
| 8 | Supervise and Refine |

### Critical Planning Concepts

#### The 1/3-2/3 Rule

Leaders use no more than **one-third** of available time for their own planning. Subordinates receive **two-thirds** of available time for their planning and preparation. This ensures parallel planning and maximum preparation time at the lowest level.

#### METT-TC Analysis Framework

The doctrinal order for analysis is:

| Letter | Factor |
|:------:|--------|
| **M** | Mission |
| **E** | Enemy/Equipment |
| **T** | Terrain and Weather |
| **T** | Troops Available |
| **T** | Time Available |
| **C** | Civil Considerations |

#### Military Aspects of Terrain (OAKOC)

| Letter | Factor |
|:------:|--------|
| **O** | Observation and Fields of Fire |
| **A** | Avenues of Approach |
| **K** | Key Terrain |
| **O** | Obstacles |
| **C** | Cover and Concealment |

### OPORD Modification Guidelines

Cadre may modify OPORDs to fit training objectives and available terrain. When modifying:

1. Update grid references to match actual training area
2. Adjust times to fit the 75-minute planning / 60-minute execution / 15-minute AAR model
3. Tailor OPFOR/Training Wrinkles to candidate experience level

> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

### Repository Access

OPORDs are maintained in Markdown format at: [github.com/mattgwagner/tlp-opords](https://github.com/mattgwagner/tlp-opords)

Cadre should download and print OPORDs prior to training. Coordinate with Senior Platoon Trainer for any required modifications or additions.
