**PATROL BASE OPERATIONS - TRAINING IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE**

**Exercise Name:** PB THUNDER Overnight Occupation
**Location:** MP 058 152, AO COTTO (Camp Blanding)
**Execution:** Single overnight occupation with leadership-centric feedback
**Candidate Population:** 26 intermediate status OCS candidates
**Cadre Requirement:** 2-3 personnel (minimal staffing model)

---

## TRAINING OVERVIEW

This guide operationalizes OPORD #008 (Patrol Base Operations) as a **realistic overnight leadership exercise** that surfaces decision-making under stress—darkness, fatigue, sustained operations—while evaluating candidates against **intermediate status standards** (competent execution, independent judgment, decreasing supervision, ownership).

Candidates have completed WARNO-based TLP planning. This exercise focuses on **execution and leadership management** of the occupation.

---

## ORGANIZATION & ROLE ASSIGNMENTS

**Platoon Structure (26 Candidates):**
- 1 Platoon Leader
- 1 Platoon Sergeant
- 3 Squad Leaders (one per squad)
- ~7-8 Squad Members per squad (18-21 total squad members)

**Role Selection Approach:**
- PL/PSG: Select based on second-look evaluation status or rotate if multiple candidates need experience
- SLs: Assign 3 candidates who are ready for mid-level leadership assessment
- Squad Members: Remaining candidates fill squad positions; serve as active participants and observers of leadership

---

## EXECUTION TIMELINE

**Pre-Exercise Day (Before Movement)**
- Brief all 26 candidates on MP 058 152 location and occupancy deadline (NLT 2200)
- Clarify role assignments and intermediate status evaluation context
- Confirm OPORD understanding: occupation technique choice, sector assignments, security priorities
- Review patrol base sustainment expectations (water, meals, rest plan, stand-to procedures)
- Brief cadre on observation focus: leadership independence, ownership, supervision quality

**Movement & Occupation (Daylight to Darkness)**
- Candidates move to MP 058 152
- Transition to darkness during movement to occupation
- **Occupation complete NLT 2200**: Platoon occupies PB THUNDER using triangle or cigar technique
- Squads occupy assigned sectors (north, southeast, southwest per OPORD)
- Security established: fighting positions, LP/OPs, comms with higher

**Overnight Operations**
- **EENT Stand-To** (30 min before Evening Nautical Twilight): 100% alert, all personnel in fighting positions
- **Sustainment Phase**: Squad leaders manage rest rotation, water resupply, security patrols, CCIR monitoring
- **Night Management**: PSG supervises priorities of work; SLs manage sectors independently; PL maintains overall command
- **Cadre Observation**: Roving observers note leadership decisions, initiative, deference patterns, problem anticipation vs. reaction

**Early Morning Operations**
- **BMNT Stand-To** (30 min before Beginning Morning Nautical Twilight): 100% alert, all personnel in fighting positions
- **PL/PSG Assessment**: Platoon leadership assesses security posture before stand-down order
- **Stand-Down**: Only after PL or PSG conducts assessment and issues order

**AAR & Debrief (Post-Stand-Down)**
- 45-60 minute leadership-focused AAR
- Feedback directly tied to intermediate status standards and second-look evaluation context
- Return to primary location

## CADRE OBSERVATION FRAMEWORK (MINIMAL STAFFING)

**Senior Cadre (1 person) - Platoon Leadership Focus**
- Position at PL CP during occupation and overnight
- Observes: PL occupation decisions, PSG management of priorities, communication clarity to squad leaders
- Records: Independence of decision-making, who is directing vs. reacting, PSG active vs. passive supervision, PL situational awareness
- **Key observation moments**: Occupation start, first CCIR report, overnight sustainment decisions, stand-to procedures

**Roving Cadre (1-2 people) - Squad Leader Focus**
- Rotate through squad sectors during occupation and overnight
- Observes: Individual SL sector management, proactive vs. reactive leadership, communication with squad
- Records: SL positioning to observe sector, position checks vs. passive monitoring, proactive problem identification, deferral patterns to PSG
- **Key observation moments**: Squad occupation completion, mid-night security checks, stand-to procedures

**Cadre Posture:** Silent observation except for safety. Collect specific examples for AAR feedback.

**Intervention Threshold:** Medical emergency, loss of unit control, darkness safety hazards only. Do not intervene in leadership decisions or problem-solving.

## AAR & LEADERSHIP FEEDBACK

**AAR Structure (45-60 minutes)**

**1. What Happened (10 min)**
- PL summarizes occupation decisions and overnight management
- PSG describes squad leader supervision approach and priorities management
- Squad leaders briefly summarize sector management

**2. What Was Supposed to Happen (5 min)**
- Reference OPORD intent: secure patrol base, maintain security, enable sustainment
- Establish standard: **Intermediate Status** = competent execution with decreasing supervision, independent judgment, proactive ownership

**3. What We Learned (20-30 min) — LEADERSHIP-CENTRIC**

**PL Feedback:**
- Did you make independent decisions about security, or seek approval?
- Did you anticipate problems or react to them after they emerged?
- How did you ensure squad leaders understood your intent without hand-holding?
- *Frame*: Command presence, judgment quality, decreasing supervision expectations

**PSG Feedback:**
- How actively did you supervise vs. direct? Did you check on initiatives or just give orders?
- Did you hold SLs accountable for sector results or compliance with instructions?
- At what point would you have relieved an SL from leadership?
- *Frame*: Supervision quality, holding subordinates accountable, immediate relief decision-making

**SL Feedback:**
- How often did you defer to the PSG before acting on a problem?
- What problems did you identify and fix independently?
- How did you communicate to your squad without PSG present?
- What didn't you think to check on?
- *Frame*: Ownership, initiative, independent judgment, anticipation

**Connection to Second-Look Evaluation:**
- Explicitly frame feedback: *"At intermediate status, this shows [competence/judgment/ownership issue]"*
- Reference blue card language: *"This demonstrates the independent decision-making we expect from a Second Lieutenant"* or *"This reflects [unacceptable attitude/motivation/judgment issue]"*
- Tie to relief criteria: *"Not Satisfactory performance in this area would result in recommendation for relief from OCS"*

**4. What Now (5-10 min)**
- Individual feedback to PL, PSG, SLs on specific leadership behaviors for next exercise
- Candidate self-assessment: What went well? What would you do differently?

## PRE-EXERCISE CANDIDATE PREPARATION

**Candidates Should Know:**
1. **Patrol Base Occupation Techniques**: Triangle vs. cigar-shaped formations, sector advantages/disadvantages, terrain application
2. **CCIR and Reporting**: What to report, when to report, format (SALUTE, SITREP, LACE per OPORD)
3. **Stand-To Procedures**: Timing (30 min before BMNT/EENT), 100% alert requirements, stand-down criteria
4. **Squad Leader Responsibilities**: Sector management, position checks, communication to squad, problem identification
5. **Intermediate Status Context**: They are being evaluated on leadership judgment and ownership, not just task compliance. Mistakes at this level indicate judgment/attitude issues, not knowledge gaps. Phase I is complete.

## LOGISTICS & SUPPORT

**Equipment/Resources:**
- Radios (PACE plan per OPORD Section 5.c)
- Water resupply (candidates responsible; establish water point security per sustainment section)
- Medical support (aid bag at PL CP, MEDEVAC procedures per OPORD Section 4.b)
- Lighting: Candidates use available light discipline per patrol base security requirements
- Reporting channels: Established per OPORD; candidates report to higher per reporting schedule

**Cadre Requirements:**
- 2-3 personnel for observation and safety oversight
- Communication (radios or runners)
- Transportation to MP 058 152 area

**Safety Oversight:**
- Roving cadre monitor for darkness hazards (falls, disorientation, friendly fire risk)
- Medical readiness (aid bag accessibility, MEDEVAC knowledge)
- No dedicated safety observer; integration into cadre observation role

---

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

- **OPORD #008**: Patrol Base Operations (full operational order)
  - Mission statement, task organization, situation, execution, sustainment, command & signal
  - Rules of engagement, CCIR, reporting requirements, stand-to procedures

---

## KEY EVALUATION LANGUAGE (Intermediate Status)

**Leadership Competence at Intermediate Status:**
- Evaluation measures performance against **Second Lieutenant standard**, not peer comparison
- Candidates are expected to demonstrate leader competence through **sound judgment with decreasing supervision**
- **Mistakes now indicate judgment or attitude issues**, not knowledge gaps (Phase I is complete)
- **Unacceptable attitude or motivation is grounds for immediate relief**
- **Not Satisfactory LER results in recommendation for relief from OCS**

**Ownership-Based Leadership:**
- Independent problem identification and correction
- Direct accountability without deferring to higher unless clearly necessary
- Proactive communication of status and issues
- Immediate execution of feedback with measurable improvement

**Supervision Standards:**
- Leaders held accountable for **results of subordinates, not intentions**
- Squad leader supervision means demanding competent execution, not providing support
- Platoon sergeants must be prepared to assume command immediately without hesitation

---

## NOTES FOR CADRE CONDUCTING THIS EXERCISE

1. **Frame the context**: Candidates understand this is a leadership assessment exercise tied to their larger evaluation. Expectations are high; mistakes reflect judgment/attitude, not knowledge gaps.

2. **Observe silently unless safety**: Resist the urge to coach or correct during execution. Let leadership decisions emerge naturally. Document them for AAR feedback.

3. **Specific examples matter**: Generic feedback ("good leadership") is useless. Record specific moments: *"At 2245, the SL did X, which showed ownership"* or *"At 0300, the PSG did Y, which shows passive supervision."*

4. **Connect to evaluation standards**: Every piece of feedback should reference intermediate status language or second-look evaluation criteria. Candidates must understand how their performance maps to promotion/relief decisions.

5. **Use the OPORD as the objective standard**: All feedback references the OPORD mission and execution plan. Did leaders accomplish the mission? How well did they command during execution?

6. **AAR is the learning moment**: The overnight exercise is data collection. The AAR is where you transform observations into learning tied to evaluation standards.
