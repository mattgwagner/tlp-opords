**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #015 / CODE NAME: "PATROL BASE OPERATIONS (COMPANY)"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Higher | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Night Iterations - Coaching Focus)
>
> **Mission Summary:** A Company is tasked to establish and occupy a patrol base in AO COTTO to conduct continuous operations, provide area security, and enable sustainment for follow-on missions. Three platoons execute distinct tasks: patrol base defense, forward screening, and company reserve.
>
> **Destination:** Patrol Base (PB) THUNDER, vicinity MP 058 152, AO COTTO, NLT ____.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Company conducts a leader's reconnaissance, occupies the patrol base with a deliberate occupation technique, establishes a screening element forward of the base on likely avenues of approach, and maintains a reserve / QRF within the perimeter. The company executes patrol base activities including security patrols, maintenance, and planning for follow-on operations.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD emphasizes company-level synchronization, echeloning security across multiple platoons, employment of a reserve, and coordination between elements with different missions. Candidates playing CO must manage fire support coordination between the screen and the patrol base, screen withdrawal procedures, and QRF employment criteria. Ideal for night training iterations or as a planning-only exercise for TLP practice.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Probe the screen line first to test whether early warning reaches the patrol base and the CO reacts appropriately.
> - Test QRF employment: simulate a penetration requiring 3rd Platoon to reinforce or counterattack.
> - Simulate compromise of an OP requiring 2nd Platoon to displace or 3rd Platoon to react.
> - Introduce an intelligence update requiring the CO to adjust platoon boundaries or reposition the screen.
> - Test ability to coordinate 2nd Platoon's withdrawal through 1st Platoon's positions under pressure.
> - Introduce resupply, casualty evacuation, or personnel issues during occupation.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.
>

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the old railroad bed, and to the west by the pine forest edge. The company area of operations extends approximately 1-2 km beyond the planned patrol base site to encompass screening positions and observation posts on likely enemy avenues of approach.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas. The trail network to the north and woodlines to the east provide concealed approaches toward the patrol base site. Open areas between the screen line and patrol base create natural observation points.

   - **Key Terrain:** The planned patrol base site at MP 058 152 offers good concealment, defensible terrain, and access to covered withdrawal routes. The surrounding woodlines provide observation points for early warning. A small creek to the south provides a water source but may also canalize enemy approach. Elevated ground to the north offers observation of likely enemy avenues of approach and is suitable for screening element observation posts. Trail junctions on the northern and eastern avenues of approach provide natural positions for screening operations.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility expected during nighttime operations; plan for EENT/BMNT stand-to procedures.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of irregular forces operating in the area who actively patrol and conduct reconnaissance to locate friendly positions. They are equipped with small arms and support weapons. They are experienced in local terrain and employ reconnaissance teams ahead of their main body to locate and assess friendly positions before committing to an attack.

**1. Composition.** Estimated reinforced squad of 10-15 REAPER personnel organized into 2-3 fire teams, equipped with small arms, 1-2 support weapons (PKM/RPK), and communications equipment. A reconnaissance element of 2-3 personnel operates ahead of the main body.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER reconnaissance teams are actively patrolling the area and maintaining observation of likely friendly positions. The REAPER main body is located to the north, with elements dispersed to avoid detection. They maintain a reserve capable of reinforcing any element in contact.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance elements locate the patrol base or screening positions and conduct sustained observation. They report findings to higher and continue surveillance while avoiding decisive engagement. Limited probing attacks test the screen line or patrol base perimeter to gather intelligence on friendly strength and disposition.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER conducts a coordinated two-element attack. The reconnaissance element fixes the screening force with harassing fire while the main body infiltrates through a gap or along a covered avenue of approach. The main body attacks the patrol base from an unexpected direction using fire and movement, attempting to penetrate the perimeter before the reserve can react. A small element attempts to cut off withdrawal routes or create confusion with fires from multiple directions.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN-211th INF.

**2. Mission.** 4th BN-211th INF conducts area security operations in the vicinity of Camp Blanding to deny REAPER freedom of movement and enable follow-on offensive operations. A Company is the battalion main effort.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Establish a forward company patrol base to project combat power into AO COTTO, disrupt REAPER reconnaissance and movement, and prepare the force for follow-on offensive operations. The company patrol base must be secure enough to sustain 48-hour operations without resupply while maintaining the ability to conduct company-level patrols and raids from the base.

**4. Adjacent Units.** B Company conducts security operations to the east. C Company is in reserve at the battalion assembly area, prepared to reinforce on order.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians may be present in the area. Patrol base operations must minimize detection and avoid contact with non-combatants to maintain operational security.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
Company receives priority of battalion 81mm mortar fires on request.

## 2. MISSION

A Company establishes and occupies Patrol Base THUNDER (vicinity MP 058 152) NLT ____ to provide area security, enable company-level sustainment, and prepare for follow-on operations in AO COTTO.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Establish a secure forward operating base in AO COTTO to project combat power, disrupt REAPER reconnaissance and movement, and posture the company for follow-on offensive operations in support of the battalion plan.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Establish and occupy PB THUNDER without compromise. (2) Establish a security zone forward of the patrol base that provides early warning and delays enemy approach. (3) Maintain a company reserve capable of reinforcing the defense or conducting a limited counterattack.

**End State:** PB THUNDER occupied and secure with an active screen providing early warning, company sustained through BMNT/EENT cycles, prepared to defend against REAPER attack or transition to follow-on offensive operations on order.

### b. Concept of Operations
A Company establishes PB THUNDER through a deliberate occupation. The main effort occupies and defends the patrol base perimeter with fighting positions and LP/OPs providing 360-degree security. A screening element operates forward on the likely avenues of approach, providing early warning and delaying enemy reconnaissance to buy time for the defense to react. A reserve element maintains readiness to reinforce the perimeter, backstop the screen, or conduct a limited counterattack. Stand-to at BMNT and EENT. The company executes priorities of work while maintaining the ability to defend in place or displace on order.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon, as the main effort defending PB THUNDER, has priority of indirect fires. Battalion 81mm mortar fires available on request. Defensive fires planned for likely REAPER avenues of approach from the north and east. Final protective fires (FPF) designated on the most dangerous avenue of approach. Fire support coordination measures established between the screen line and the patrol base perimeter to prevent fratricide during screen withdrawal.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Platoon (Patrol Base Defense — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Occupy and defend Patrol Base THUNDER (vicinity MP 058 152). Establish a perimeter defense with fighting positions providing interlocking fields of fire and 360-degree security. Man LP/OPs internal to the patrol base perimeter. Execute priorities of work including fighting position improvement, weapons maintenance, and rest rotation. Be prepared to receive elements of 2nd Platoon withdrawing through your position if the screen is compromised. Coordinate passage points and recognition signals with 2nd Platoon.
- **PURPOSE:** Secure the company patrol base as the base of operations for sustained company-level operations, ensuring the force can rest, refit, and prepare for follow-on missions while protected against REAPER assault.

**2. 2nd Platoon (Screen — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Establish a screen forward of PB THUNDER oriented on the likely avenues of approach from the north and east. Man observation posts providing continuous observation of enemy avenues of approach. Conduct security patrols between OPs to prevent enemy infiltration through gaps. Report all enemy activity immediately. Delay enemy reconnaissance elements to prevent them from observing the patrol base. Be prepared to withdraw through 1st Platoon's position on order or if the screen is penetrated by a force you cannot defeat.
- **PURPOSE:** Provide early warning of REAPER approach and delay enemy reconnaissance, giving the company time to posture the defense and employ the reserve before REAPER elements can observe or engage the patrol base.

**3. 3rd Platoon (Company Reserve / QRF):**

- **TASK:** Occupy a reserve position within PB THUNDER. Serve as the company QRF, prepared to reinforce any sector of the perimeter defense, reinforce or extract 2nd Platoon if the screen is compromised, or conduct a limited counterattack to destroy an enemy element that has penetrated the security zone. Rehearse reinforcement routes to each platoon sector. Conduct withdrawal route reconnaissance for the company. Maintain the highest state of readiness throughout the occupation.
- **PURPOSE:** Provide the Company Commander a responsive reserve capable of massing combat power at the decisive point, ensuring REAPER cannot exploit a penetration of the screen or perimeter before the company can concentrate forces.
