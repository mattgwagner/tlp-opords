The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation.

They are capable of blending into the local populace and adapting quickly to changing situations.

1. Composition. 6-8 combatants, small arms, possible HMG (Heavy Machine Gun)/RPG, in concealment.

2. Disposition. Enemy forces are generally dispersed in concealed positions throughout the area, using terrain and vegetation for cover. They maintain flexibility to regroup or withdraw and are likely to observe friendly movements from hidden vantage points.
