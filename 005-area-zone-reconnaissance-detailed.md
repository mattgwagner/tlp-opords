## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the old railroad bed, and to the west by the pine forest edge. Suspected enemy activity centered around MP 0613 1532.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The suspected REAPER position at MP 0613 1532 is the focus of reconnaissance. The area north and south of the objective is relatively open, limiting observation positions. Woodlines to the east and west provide concealment for reconnaissance elements approaching the objective.

**2. Weather.** ________ skies, temperature ____°F (heat cat ____), winds ____ at ____ mph. Chance of precipitation: ____%.
BMNT ____; sunrise ____; sunset ____; EENT ____.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of a small irregular force, likely operating from concealed positions within AO COTTO. They are equipped with small arms and may have support weapons. They are experienced in local terrain and employ security measures to avoid detection.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 4-6 REAPER personnel, small arms, possible support weapons, in concealed or defensive positions.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are likely dispersed in small groups throughout the area, using terrain and vegetation for concealment. They maintain security patrols and observation posts to detect friendly reconnaissance. Exact locations unknown – this is the purpose of the reconnaissance mission.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces maintain static defensive positions or conduct limited patrols within the area. If detected, they attempt to break contact and withdraw rather than engage decisively. They may use decoy positions or false indicators to mislead friendly reconnaissance.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces detect friendly reconnaissance and initiate an ambush or counter-reconnaissance operation. They coordinate with additional elements to encircle or fix the reconnaissance platoon, seeking to prevent intelligence collection or inflict casualties.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts reconnaissance operations to locate and assess REAPER forces in AO COTTO.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Gather intelligence on REAPER positions, strength, and disposition to enable follow-on operations and prevent REAPER freedom of action.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians may be present in the area. Reconnaissance must minimize detection and avoid contact with non-combatants to maintain operational security and good relations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts an area reconnaissance of AO COTTO NLT ____ to locate REAPER positions, assess REAPER strength and disposition, and identify key terrain features to enable follow-on operations.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Provide the company commander intelligence on REAPER forces in AO COTTO to enable planning and execution of follow-on operations.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Locate REAPER positions within AO COTTO. (2) Assess REAPER strength, disposition, and defensive preparations. (3) Identify key terrain that affects friendly or enemy operations.

**End State:** REAPER positions located, strength and disposition assessed, intelligence reported to higher, friendly forces consolidated at ORP without compromise.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts an area reconnaissance of AO COTTO from a secure ORP. Two reconnaissance elements move to assigned sectors using covered and concealed routes, collecting intelligence on REAPER positions, activities, and terrain. A security element remains at the ORP to provide a rally point and QRF capability. The platoon avoids decisive engagement — the mission is intelligence collection, not destruction. Upon completion or compromise, elements return to the ORP for consolidation and reporting.

### c. Scheme of Fires
Fires are limited to self-defense only. Avoid engagement unless necessary to break contact. Indirect fire support available through company on request to support disengagement.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Reconnaissance — Northern Sector):**

- **TASK:** Conduct reconnaissance of the northern sector of AO COTTO, focusing on the area north and east of MP 0613 1532. Locate REAPER positions, assess activity, and identify defensive preparations, obstacles, and key terrain. Use covered and concealed routes, maintain noise and light discipline, and avoid detection. Report findings via SALUTE format. Return to ORP upon completion or if compromised.
- **PURPOSE:** Confirm or deny REAPER presence in the northern sector so the company can plan follow-on operations against a known enemy picture.

**2. 2nd Squad (Reconnaissance — Southern Sector):**

- **TASK:** Conduct reconnaissance of the southern sector of AO COTTO, focusing on the area south and west of MP 0613 1532 — including the suspected REAPER position. Locate REAPER positions, assess activity, and identify defensive preparations, obstacles, and key terrain. Use covered and concealed routes, maintain noise and light discipline, and avoid detection. Report findings via SALUTE format. Return to ORP upon completion or if compromised.
- **PURPOSE:** Develop the intelligence picture in the sector most likely to contain REAPER's main position, enabling the company to identify objectives for follow-on operations.

**3. 3rd Squad (ORP Security / QRF):**

- **TASK:** Establish and secure the ORP. Maintain 360-degree security during reconnaissance operations. Monitor radio traffic from reconnaissance elements. Be prepared to move to support a compromised squad or provide suppressive fire to enable extraction. Account for all personnel upon return.
- **PURPOSE:** Ensure the reconnaissance elements have a secure base to return to and a responsive QRF if compromised, preventing a tactical emergency from becoming a decisive engagement.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Avoid engagement unless necessary for self-defense or to break contact.
   2. Do not compromise the reconnaissance mission unless absolutely necessary.
   3. Avoid civilian contact and minimize detection.
