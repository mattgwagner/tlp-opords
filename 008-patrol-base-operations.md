**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #008 / CODE NAME: "PATROL BASE OPERATIONS"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Moderate | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Night Iterations - Coaching Focus)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to establish and occupy a patrol base in AO COTTO to conduct continuous operations, provide security, and enable sustainment for follow-on missions.
>
> **Destination:** Patrol Base (PB) THUNDER, vicinity MP 0625 1555, AO COTTO.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will conduct a leader's reconnaissance, occupy the patrol base using the triangle or cigar-shaped technique, establish security, and conduct patrol base activities including security patrols, maintenance, and planning for follow-on operations.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD emphasizes security priorities, patrol base setup, and sustainment operations. Links directly to the Patrol Base Operations Training Package. Ideal for night training iterations where static operations allow focus on security fundamentals without the complexity of offensive maneuver.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Simulate enemy reconnaissance probes during occupation or stand-to.
> - Test candidate's ability to establish and maintain security priorities.
> - Introduce resupply, casualty evacuation, or personnel issues during occupation.
> - Cadre can inject intelligence updates requiring adjustment to the patrol base plan.
> - Test ability to conduct patrol base activities while maintaining security.
> - Introduce a compromise scenario requiring displacement or defense.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the railroad tracks, and to the west by the pine forest edge. The planned patrol base site is in a wooded area with good concealment and defensible terrain.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The planned patrol base site at MP 0625 1555 offers good concealment, defensible terrain, and access to covered withdrawal routes. The surrounding woodlines provide observation points for early warning. A small creek to the south provides a water source but may also canalize enemy approach. Elevated ground to the north offers observation of likely enemy avenues of approach.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility expected during nighttime operations; plan for EENT/BMNT stand-to procedures.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of irregular forces operating in the area who actively patrol and conduct reconnaissance to locate friendly positions. They are equipped with small arms and may have support weapons. They are experienced in local terrain and may attempt to probe or attack friendly positions if discovered.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 6-8 REAPER personnel, small arms, possible support weapons, operating in 2-3 person reconnaissance teams and larger assault elements.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are dispersed throughout the area, conducting patrols and reconnaissance. They maintain observation posts on likely routes and are prepared to report and engage friendly forces. Main body elements are positioned to reinforce reconnaissance teams if contact is made.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance elements detect friendly patrol base and conduct observation to assess strength and disposition. They report findings to higher and may conduct limited probing attacks to test friendly defenses before withdrawing to plan a larger operation.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance detects patrol base occupation and rapidly coordinates a multi-element attack. REAPER forces conduct a coordinated assault using indirect fire, support weapons, and assault elements to overwhelm friendly positions before reinforcements can arrive.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts area security operations in AO COTTO to deny REAPER freedom of movement and enable follow-on offensive operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Establish a secure patrol base to enable continuous operations, maintain security of the platoon, and prepare for follow-on missions. The patrol base must be positioned and organized to allow rapid response to enemy contact while providing for sustainment and rest of the force.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians may be present in the area. Patrol base operations must minimize detection and avoid contact with non-combatants to maintain operational security.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon establishes and occupies Patrol Base THUNDER (vicinity MP 0625 1555) NLT ____ to provide security, enable sustainment, and prepare for follow-on operations in AO COTTO.

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**i) Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon establishes and occupies a secure patrol base to enable continuous operations, maintain security of the platoon, and prepare for follow-on missions.

**ii) Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to establish a secure patrol base to enable continuous operations, maintain security of the platoon, and prepare for follow-on missions while denying REAPER freedom of movement in AO COTTO.

**iii) End State.** Patrol Base THUNDER is established and occupied, security is maintained, the platoon is positioned for follow-on operations, and REAPER freedom of movement is denied in AO COTTO.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a leader's reconnaissance of the patrol base site, then occupies the patrol base using the appropriate technique (triangle or cigar-shaped based on terrain). Squads are assigned sectors of the perimeter with interlocking fields of fire. The platoon establishes security including observation posts, listening posts, and a security patrol schedule. The platoon conducts patrol base activities including weapons maintenance, personal hygiene, rest plan, and planning for follow-on operations. Stand-to is conducted at BMNT and EENT. The platoon maintains the capability to defend the patrol base or displace on order.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Platoon halts short of patrol base site; PL conducts leader's reconnaissance with security element.

- Squads occupy assigned sectors; each squad establishes fighting positions with interlocking fires.
- LP/OPs established on likely enemy avenues of approach.
- Patrol schedule established for local security patrols.
- Withdrawal routes identified and briefed to all personnel.

### d. Scheme of Fires
Defensive fires planned for likely REAPER avenues of approach. Each squad responsible for fires within assigned sector. Priority of fires to the most likely avenue of approach (determined during leader's reconnaissance). Final protective fires (FPF) designated and briefed.
