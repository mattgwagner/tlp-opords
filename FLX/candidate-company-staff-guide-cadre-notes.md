# CADRE NOTES — Candidate Company Staff Guide

**FOR CADRE USE ONLY — DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES**

---

## Selecting Candidates for Company Staff

### When to Select
Friday evening, after FRAGO 007. Cadre has observed candidates for ~18 hours (Thursday planning + Friday execution) and should have a clear picture of top performers. Selecting Friday evening gives the candidate staff time to receive OPORD 008 and prepare their brief overnight.

### Selection Criteria
Look for candidates who have demonstrated:
- **Strong TLP execution** — produced a coherent plan when given an OPORD (Thursday/Friday)
- **Clear communication** — issued orders that subordinates could understand and act on
- **Situational awareness** — tracked the tactical picture and adapted to changing conditions
- **Initiative** — didn't wait to be told; identified problems and acted
- **Peer leadership** — others naturally look to them for guidance

### Who NOT to Select
- Candidates who still need SL evaluation lanes (haven't had enough opportunities yet)
- Candidates you want to see under pressure at the SL level one more time
- Candidates who are strong executors but haven't demonstrated planning ability

### How to Announce
Brief the selected candidates privately. Frame it as: "You've demonstrated strong performance. We're putting you in a company staff role for the rest of the FLX. You'll be planning and issuing orders to the squad leaders. This is a leadership evaluation — we're watching how you plan at a higher level and how clearly you can issue orders."

## Evaluation Criteria by Role

| Role | Evaluated On |
|------|-------------|
| **CO** | Planning quality, order clarity, decision-making during execution |
| **XO** | Staff work, battle tracking, logistics foresight |
| **BC/RTO** | Radio discipline, information processing, communication clarity |

## Staff vs. SL Planning Boundary — Cadre Enforcement

The staff says WHAT each squad does. The SL plans HOW. If the candidate CO starts briefing fire team assignments or dictating how the squad moves, redirect: *"CO, that's the SL's plan. Give them their task and purpose and let them figure out how."*

This protects the SL evaluation space. Even on the capstone (006), SLs still own their squad-level execution planning.

## Cadre Coaching Guidance by Lane

| Lane | Cadre coaching level |
|------|---------------------|
| 008 MTC | Coach the staff through the first briefing format if needed — this is their first time |
| 003 Ambush | Light coaching — they've done this once. Observe whether they're improving. |
| 009 Intercept | Observe — less information to work with (FRAGO). See how they handle abbreviated input. |
| 004 Raid | Observe and evaluate improvement — by the fourth order, they should be efficient |
| 006 Deliberate Attack | **Do not coach.** This is the capstone evaluation — observe and assess. |

For all lanes: have the cadre detailed version of the OPORD ready as a safety net. Watch how the CO handles SL questions during the brief — a good CO can explain their reasoning; a weak CO freezes.

## Safety Net Procedures

### When to Intervene
- The candidate CO's order is missing critical information that SLs need to plan (no scheme of maneuver, no squad tasks, no timeline)
- SLs are visibly confused and cannot begin TLPs after 15 minutes
- The tactical plan is genuinely dangerous (not just suboptimal — actually unsafe)

### How to Intervene
1. **First**: Coach through the candidate CO. "CO, your SLs don't know where 2nd Squad is supposed to be. What's their task?"
2. **Second**: If the CO can't recover, provide the candidate staff with specific guidance from the cadre detailed version
3. **Last resort**: Cadre issues the pre-scripted order directly. This counts as a significant evaluation event for the candidate CO.

### What Is NOT an Intervention
- The plan is different from what cadre would have done — that's fine, it's their plan
- The plan has minor gaps that SLs can work around — let the SLs adapt
- Execution doesn't go as planned — that's a learning moment, not a failure

## Evaluation Notes

### What to Watch For — Company Staff

| Candidate | Strong Performance | Weak Performance |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **CO** | Coherent plan, clear brief, handles SL questions, makes decisions during execution | Rambling brief, SLs confused, freezes when asked questions, won't make decisions |
| **XO** | Maintains running estimates, anticipates logistics issues, tracks the operation | Loses track of personnel status, no logistics awareness, passive in CP |
| **BC/RTO** | Processes reports promptly, maintains comms discipline, keeps board updated | Misses reports, loses comms with elements, board is blank or wrong |

### Connecting to the FLER
These are leadership evaluation opportunities. Document them the same way you would a TLP lane:
- **Did the candidate plan?** (Staff work, order development)
- **Did the candidate communicate?** (Order brief, radio management, information flow)
- **Did the candidate lead?** (Decisions during execution, adaptation, presence)

## OPORD Handling Notes

The Saturday OPORDs (003, 004, 006, 008, 009) are candidate working copies — print them and hand them to the staff. They contain only operational content with no cadre evaluation language. The staff works from these to develop their squad taskings.

For the capstone (006), the staff receives only a mission statement with reference information. The detailed OPORD exists in cadre files as a safety net — do not distribute to candidates unless intervention is required.
