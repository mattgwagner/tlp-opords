## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. 1st Platoon occupies COP Seggel (MP 0610 1550). Reconnaissance operations have confirmed REAPER is using the Bradenton Avenue corridor south of COP Seggel to move supplies and personnel between positions. Patrols observed a REAPER resupply element moving north along Bradenton Avenue on a regular schedule, passing through the vicinity of MP 0600 1530. This route is REAPER's primary logistics line in AO HERRERA.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the AO, flanked by dense pine and hardwood forests. The stretch of Bradenton Avenue near MP 0600 1530 is a straight, improved road with limited vegetation on the road surface but dense woodlines within 10-20 meters on both sides — ideal for a linear ambush. The road provides a natural kill zone with limited escape routes for vehicles or dismounted personnel. Woodlines on both sides of the road provide concealed positions for assault and support elements. A trail network in the woodlines west of Bradenton Avenue offers covered withdrawal routes back toward COP Seggel.

   - **Key Terrain:** The ambush site along Bradenton Avenue (vicinity MP 0600 1530) provides a natural kill zone bounded by dense vegetation. The woodline on the west side of Bradenton Avenue offers concealed assault and SBF positions with clear observation of the road. The trail junction west of Bradenton Avenue provides a withdrawal route and ORP location. The intersection at MP 0600 1523 (Arcadia St and Bradenton Ave) to the south is a potential REAPER reinforcement route.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 06 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: High 78°F / Low 63°F (heat cat 1 — green)
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0557
   - Sunrise: 0648
   - Sunset: 1831
   - EENT: 1922

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
Reconnaissance confirms REAPER is using Bradenton Avenue as a logistics route, moving supplies north from positions south of the AO. Resupply elements consist of small parties (3-5 personnel) moving on foot or with hand carts along the road, typically with a lead scout 50-100 meters ahead of the main body.

**1. Composition.** Expected target: 3-5 REAPER personnel with small arms, resupply materials, and possibly documents or communications equipment. Lead scout with radio. Main body with supplies.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER resupply elements move north along Bradenton Avenue, passing through the vicinity of MP 0600 1530. Movement typically occurs during [morning/afternoon — cadre determines]. A REAPER observation post may be positioned near the Arcadia Street intersection (MP 0600 1523) to provide early warning for the supply route.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER resupply element moves north along Bradenton Avenue with a lead scout. Upon ambush initiation, surviving REAPER personnel attempt to break contact east into the woodlines or south along Bradenton Avenue toward the Arcadia Street intersection.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has a security element pre-positioned in the woodlines east of Bradenton Avenue to overwatch the supply route. Upon ambush initiation, the security element engages the assault force from the flank while the supply element breaks contact south and calls for reinforcement from positions south of the AO.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company disrupts REAPER logistics in AO HERRERA to degrade their combat capability and develop intelligence for follow-on operations.

**3. Adjacent Units.** COP Seggel remains manned and defended during the ambush. Elements not conducting the ambush maintain security at the COP.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilian traffic along Bradenton Avenue is possible. Positively identify all targets before initiating the ambush. Do not engage civilians. If civilians are present in the kill zone, do not initiate — allow them to pass and reset.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

A Company disrupts REAPER logistics in AO HERRERA by conducting an ambush along the Bradenton Avenue corridor NLT ____ on ____ MAR 26 in order to degrade REAPER combat capability and capture intelligence. 1st Platoon conducts the ambush.

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Destroy a REAPER resupply element to sever their logistics line along Bradenton Avenue and exploit captured materials for intelligence.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Establish an ambush along the Bradenton Avenue corridor vicinity MP 0600 1530. (2) Destroy or capture the REAPER resupply element. (3) Collect all documents, electronics, and materials of intelligence value. (4) Withdraw to COP Seggel before REAPER can react with reinforcements.

**End State:** REAPER resupply element destroyed or captured, intelligence materials collected, platoon returned to COP Seggel, COP security maintained throughout.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon departs COP Seggel, moves to an ORP, establishes an ambush along the Bradenton Avenue corridor, destroys the REAPER resupply element, conducts search and collection on the objective, and withdraws to COP Seggel. The platoon must maintain security of COP Seggel with the elements not conducting the ambush. Time on the objective is limited — conduct a hasty search, collect intelligence materials, and withdraw before REAPER reinforcement. Indirect fire support is available through company on request.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon has priority of indirect fires. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Priority of fires to the assault element during the ambush.
