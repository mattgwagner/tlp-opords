**Time Zone Used Throughout the Plan/Order:** EASTERN STANDARD TIME

**Task Organization:**

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. REAPER forces maintain presence across the broader AO HERRERA, with reported activity along the road network north and west of COP Seggel. REAPER reconnaissance elements were observed during the platoon's movement from RTI but withdrew before contact, indicating active surveillance of friendly operations. REAPER disposition in the surrounding area remains largely unknown.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The AO consists of flat terrain with sandy soils and dense pine and hardwood forests throughout. Thick vegetation and tree canopy severely limit observation and fields of fire except along improved roads and clearings. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center of the AO. Jacksonville Street runs east-west approximately 150 meters north of COP Seggel, intersecting Bradenton Avenue at MP 0602 1565. Clearwater Avenue runs north-south approximately 250 meters west of Bradenton Avenue. The dense woodlines between these road corridors provide concealment for both reconnaissance elements and enemy positions. Observation is restricted to under 50 meters in the woodlines.

   - **Key Terrain:** The road junction at Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565) is a known area of REAPER activity and the most likely approach for reinforcement from the north. The woodlines west of COP Seggel between Bradenton Avenue and Clearwater Avenue offer concealed approach routes to the COP. The Clearwater Avenue corridor (vicinity MP 0575 1538) provides a secondary north-south route that REAPER may use to bypass Bradenton Avenue.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 05 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: High 78°F / Low 63°F (heat cat 1 — green)
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0558
   - Sunrise: 0649
   - Sunset: 1830
   - EENT: 1921

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces withdrew from the immediate vicinity of COP Seggel during the platoon's approach but remain active in AO HERRERA. REAPER observers were spotted during the movement from RTI and likely reported the platoon's arrival and disposition. REAPER is expected to be monitoring COP Seggel from concealed positions and maintaining their presence along the road network.

**1. Composition.** Estimated squad-sized REAPER element (8-12 personnel) operating in the AO with small arms, possible indirect fire capability, IEDs, and communications equipment.

**2. Disposition.** Unknown — this is the purpose of the reconnaissance. REAPER is likely maintaining observation posts along Jacksonville Street, in the woodlines north and west of COP Seggel, and possibly along the Clearwater Avenue corridor.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER maintains dispersed observation posts to monitor friendly activity at COP Seggel and along the road network. REAPER avoids decisive engagement with reconnaissance patrols and withdraws when detected, reporting friendly patrol routes and patterns to higher.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has established a deliberate ambush along a likely reconnaissance route to destroy or capture a friendly patrol element operating away from the COP.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company conducts reconnaissance operations from COP Seggel to develop the intelligence picture in AO HERRERA and set conditions for follow-on offensive operations.

**3. Adjacent Units.** COP Seggel remains manned and defended during the reconnaissance. Elements not conducting reconnaissance maintain security at the COP.

### e. Civil Considerations
Host nation civilians may be present along the road network, particularly Jacksonville Street and the improved roads. Reconnaissance elements should note civilian presence, activity patterns, and any interaction with REAPER forces. Do not compromise the mission through unnecessary civilian contact.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

A Company conducts area reconnaissance of the terrain surrounding COP Seggel NLT ____ on ____ MAR 26 in order to locate REAPER positions and develop the intelligence picture for follow-on operations. 1st Platoon conducts the reconnaissance.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Develop actionable intelligence on REAPER disposition, strength, and routes in the area surrounding COP Seggel to enable the company to plan and execute offensive operations.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Reconnoiter NAI 1 (Jacksonville Street corridor) and NAI 2 (western woodlines / Clearwater Avenue corridor). (2) Locate and report REAPER positions, observation posts, routes, and activity. (3) Avoid decisive engagement — do not become fixed. (4) Return to COP Seggel with all personnel and equipment.

**End State:** Company has a confirmed picture of REAPER disposition in the area surrounding COP Seggel, including enemy positions, likely routes, and activity patterns. Reconnaissance elements returned to COP. COP security maintained throughout.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts area reconnaissance of two Named Areas of Interest from COP Seggel. Reconnaissance elements depart the COP, reconnoiter their assigned NAIs, and return to the COP upon completion. The platoon must maintain security of COP Seggel with the elements not conducting the reconnaissance. Avoid decisive engagement — the mission is to observe and report, not to fight. Indirect fire support is available through company on request.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon has priority of indirect fires. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Priority of fires to the element in contact.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Recon Element — NAI 1):**

- **TASK:** Depart COP Seggel and conduct area reconnaissance of NAI 1 (Jacksonville Street corridor, vicinity MP 0602 1565, extending 300m east and west of the Bradenton Avenue intersection). Locate and report REAPER observation posts, fighting positions, routes, and activity along Jacksonville Street and the woodlines north of the COP. Report all sightings via SALUTE format. Avoid decisive engagement — break contact and report if detected. Return to COP Seggel NLT ____.
- **PURPOSE:** Confirm REAPER presence and disposition along the most dangerous avenue of approach to COP Seggel.

**2. 2nd Squad (Recon Element — NAI 2):**

- **TASK:** Depart COP Seggel and conduct area reconnaissance of NAI 2 (western woodlines and Clearwater Avenue corridor, vicinity MP 0575 1538, from Clearwater Avenue east to the COP perimeter). Locate and report REAPER positions, routes, supply caches, and any prepared ambush or fighting positions in the dense woodlines west of the COP. Report all sightings via SALUTE format. Avoid decisive engagement — break contact and report if detected. Return to COP Seggel NLT ____.
- **PURPOSE:** Determine REAPER use of the western woodlines and Clearwater Avenue corridor as an approach route or staging area for operations against COP Seggel.

**3. 3rd Squad (COP Security):**

- **TASK:** Maintain security of COP Seggel during the reconnaissance. Man the ECP, maintain perimeter security with at least 50% manning, continue battle tracking at the company CP, and monitor both company and platoon nets. Be prepared to dispatch the QRF to support either reconnaissance element in contact. Track reconnaissance element positions and report any loss of communications to the PL.
