## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. AO HERRERA encompasses the Local Training Area from the RTI complex south and west to COP Seggel and the surrounding woodlines. REAPER forces have been operating throughout the area since host nation security forces vacated the facility complex at COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550). The road junction at Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565), approximately 150 meters north of COP Seggel, is a known area of REAPER activity and controls the primary avenue of approach into the AO from the north.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The AO consists of flat terrain with sandy soils and dense pine and hardwood forests throughout. Thick vegetation and tree canopy severely limit observation and fields of fire except along improved roads and clearings. The route from the RTI to COP Seggel passes through dense woodlines with limited visibility (under 50 meters off-road), intersected by improved and unimproved roads and trails. Several danger areas exist along the route including road crossings and open areas. COP Seggel is a facility complex situated along Bradenton Avenue at MP 0600 1550. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center of the AO, serving as the primary improved road and avenue of approach. Jacksonville Street runs east-west approximately 150 meters north of the COP. The facility complex includes multiple buildings and hardened structures surrounded by dense woodlines on all sides. Open areas within and immediately surrounding the facility provide limited fields of fire along the road corridors.

   - **Key Terrain:** The facility complex at COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550) is the decisive terrain. The intersection of Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565), approximately 150 meters north of the COP, controls north-south and east-west movement and represents the most likely avenue of approach for REAPER reinforcement. Bradenton Avenue south of the COP provides a cleared lane of observation and fire along the southern approach. Entrance points to the facility along Bradenton Avenue are critical for controlling access. Dense woodlines surrounding the facility on all sides offer concealment for REAPER reconnaissance elements or assault forces. Buildings within the complex that provide overhead cover are critical for CP operations and protection against indirect fire.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 05 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: High 78°F / Low 63°F (heat cat 1 — green)
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0558
   - Sunrise: 0649
   - Sunset: 1830
   - EENT: 1921

Plan for sustained operations through day and night cycles. Temperatures are moderate but heat casualties remain a concern during movement under load; ensure adequate hydration.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are an irregular force operating throughout AO HERRERA. Following the host nation withdrawal from COP Seggel, REAPER has expanded operations in the area. They are capable of conducting reconnaissance, small-unit attacks, indirect fire, and coordinated assaults. REAPER has demonstrated interest in controlling key infrastructure to stage their own operations. REAPER is familiar with the road network, woodlines, and facility layout throughout the AO.

**1. Composition.** Estimated squad-sized REAPER element (8-12 personnel) operating in the AO, equipped with small arms (AK-47s), possible mortar or indirect fire capability, IEDs, and communications equipment. A larger REAPER element of up to platoon size may be available to reinforce within 4-6 hours from the north along Jacksonville Street.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER reconnaissance elements are active throughout the AO, monitoring routes between the RTI and COP Seggel. REAPER likely has an observation element near the facility at COP Seggel monitoring the road network, particularly Bradenton Avenue and the road junction at Jacksonville Street (MP 0602 1565). If REAPER has occupied the facility, they will have established hasty defensive positions oriented along Bradenton Avenue and the east-west access roads.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance elements observe and report friendly movement from the RTI toward COP Seggel without engaging. Upon detecting friendly approach to the COP along Bradenton Avenue, REAPER observers withdraw north toward the Jacksonville Street junction or into the woodlines west of the COP and report friendly strength and disposition to higher. REAPER conducts harassing indirect fire from positions north of Jacksonville Street to disrupt occupation and probes the perimeter with small reconnaissance elements to assess defensive posture.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has occupied and fortified COP Seggel as a staging base. Upon friendly approach, REAPER defends the facility while calling for reinforcement from the north. A platoon-sized REAPER element conducts a coordinated counterattack south along Bradenton Avenue and through the woodlines west of the COP, employing indirect fire to suppress defensive positions while assault elements attack from the north and west.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company establishes a forward presence in AO HERRERA to deny REAPER freedom of movement and enable follow-on offensive operations. COP Seggel will serve as the company command post and base of operations for sustained operations throughout the AO.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Move to and seize COP Seggel to establish a persistent forward operating base. The facility must be cleared, occupied, and prepared to support company-level operations for a minimum of 48 hours. The platoon must be prepared to defend the COP against REAPER counterattack while simultaneously establishing the command post and supporting follow-on missions originating from and returning to the COP.

### e. Civil Considerations
Host nation security forces recently vacated the facility. Host nation civilians or contractors may be in the surrounding area, particularly along Jacksonville Street and the improved roads east of the COP. Any host nation personnel encountered should be treated respectfully, identified, and reported to higher. Materials and equipment left behind by host nation forces should be inventoried and reported. Avoid damage to facility infrastructure that will be used for sustained operations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon moves from the RTI to COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550) via CP ANVIL (MP ____) and CP FORGE (MP ____), clears and occupies the facility, and establishes entrance and perimeter security and the company command post NLT ____ in order to enable follow-on operations in AO HERRERA.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Establish a persistent forward operating base at COP Seggel to enable company-level command and control and provide a secure base for follow-on operations throughout AO HERRERA.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Move the platoon from the RTI to COP Seggel maintaining security throughout. (2) Clear all facilities at COP Seggel. (3) Establish entrance control and perimeter security. (4) Stand up the company command post with battle tracking and dual-net communications.

**End State:** Platoon at COP Seggel, facilities cleared, perimeter secured with ECP controlling the Bradenton Avenue approach, company CP operational on company and platoon nets, defensive positions prepared against indirect fire and ground attack, platoon postured for sustained operations and follow-on missions.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a four-phase operation. In **Phase 1 (Movement)**, the platoon moves tactically from the RTI through CP ANVIL and CP FORGE to a security halt vicinity COP Seggel. The platoon uses traveling overwatch, shifting to bounding overwatch at danger areas or when contact is likely. In **Phase 2 (Approach)**, the PL conducts a leader's reconnaissance to assess enemy presence and confirm the scheme of maneuver. In **Phase 3 (Clear)**, the assault element clears all facilities while the support element fixes any enemy resistance and the security element cordons the objective against reinforcement. In **Phase 4 (Occupy and Establish)**, the platoon transitions to defense — establishing entrance control, perimeter security oriented toward the most dangerous avenues of approach, and the company command post. Main effort shifts from the assault element (Phase 3) to the PSG and CP operations (Phase 4). A QRF capability is maintained throughout occupation.

### c. Scheme of Movement (Phase 1)
- Order of march: 1st Squad (point/lead), Platoon Headquarters, 2nd Squad, 3rd Squad (trail/rear security).
- Movement technique: Traveling overwatch; shift to bounding overwatch at danger areas or if contact is likely.
- Maintain 50-meter intervals between squads; adjust based on terrain and visibility.
- Conduct security halts at CP ANVIL (MP ____) and CP FORGE (MP ____).
- Actions at danger areas per SOP: halt, establish security, recon, cross, continue movement.
- Route: RTI (MP ____) → CP ANVIL (MP ____) → CP FORGE (MP ____) → Security Halt vic. COP Seggel (MP ____).

### d. Scheme of Fires
No planned fires during Phase 1 (Movement). 1st Squad, as the lead element, has priority of indirect fires during movement. Priority of indirect fires shifts to the assault element during Phase 3 (Clear) and remains with the element covering the most dangerous avenue of approach during Phase 4 (Occupy). Indirect fire support available through company on request. Defensive fires planned for the Bradenton Avenue corridor (north and south) and the woodlines to the west.

### e. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Lead Security, Phase 1 / Assault — Decisive Operation, Phase 3):**
