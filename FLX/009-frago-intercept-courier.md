**Time Zone Used Throughout the Plan/Order:** EASTERN STANDARD TIME

**DTG:** ______ MAR 26

## 1. SITUATION

Documents recovered during the ambush on the REAPER resupply element (OPORD 003) include a courier schedule. Intelligence analysis indicates a REAPER courier carrying orders and communications from REAPER higher command is expected to transit through the area within the next 2 hours, moving south along the Clearwater Avenue corridor (vicinity MP 0575 1538) toward REAPER positions south of the AO. The courier is traveling on foot with a single escort. Capturing the courier and the communications they carry will provide critical intelligence on REAPER's remaining strength, command structure, and intentions.

**Enemy:** REAPER courier — 1 courier plus 1 escort, both armed with small arms. Traveling light and fast. The courier's priority is speed and avoiding detection, not fighting. If confronted, the escort will attempt to delay while the courier escapes with the documents. The courier may attempt to destroy documents if capture is imminent.

**Friendly:** COP Seggel remains manned. This is a time-sensitive mission — the courier window is limited.

**Time constraint:** The courier is expected to pass through the Clearwater Avenue corridor within 2 hours of this FRAGO. The SL must plan and execute rapidly.

## 2. MISSION

No change to company mission. 1st Platoon intercepts a REAPER courier transiting the Clearwater Avenue corridor (vicinity MP 0575 1538) NLT ____ in order to capture enemy communications and intelligence on REAPER command structure and intentions.

## 3. EXECUTION

**Changes to OPORD 001:**

**Task to 1st Platoon:** Intercept and capture the REAPER courier transiting south along the Clearwater Avenue corridor (vicinity MP 0575 1538). Capture the courier alive if possible — the documents they carry are the priority. Prevent destruction of documents and communications equipment. Recover all materials and return to COP Seggel.

Both squads participate in the intercept.

**Commander's Guidance:**
- Speed is critical — the courier window is limited. Plan rapidly.
- Capture is preferred over kill. The courier's documents are more valuable than the courier.
- If the courier detects the ambush and attempts to flee, pursue briefly but do not overextend. The documents are the objective, not a running fight through the woodlines.
- Both squads are committed — COP security is notional during this operation.

**Coordinating Instructions:**
- Report when departing COP, when in position, and upon contact.
- Report immediately if courier is captured with documents.
- If courier does not appear within the 2-hour window, withdraw to COP and report.
- Challenge/password remains: Viper / Strike.
