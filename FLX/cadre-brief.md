# FLX Cadre Brief — March 2026

**CADRE USE ONLY — DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES**

**Operation SPRING STRIKE — Class 065 Culmination FLX**
05-08 March 2026 | CBJTC, Starke, FL

---

## Weekend Overview

This is the culmination Field Leadership Exercise for Class 065. The FLX is a 48-hour field exercise built around a single narrative: 1st Platoon moves to, occupies, and operates from Combat Outpost Seggel in AO HERRERA. Every mission flows from the one before it. Candidates rotate through squad leader roles across nine lanes (six full OPORDs and three FRAGOs), each building on the evolving tactical situation.

Cadre issues each OPORD as a platoon-level order. The evaluated candidate (as SL) receives the order, conducts TLP, develops their scheme of maneuver and team-level tasks, briefs it, and executes. We do not prescribe how the candidate organizes their element — that's the evaluation.

## Thursday — FLX Preparation Training + OPORD 001 Issue

The student chain of command selects candidates to prepare and deliver training on the tasks below. **All rated squad leaders will lead at least one of these training sessions.** This is an evaluated event — assess preparation quality, delivery, and demonstrated knowledge. These are also the skills they'll need to execute the FLX, so the training directly feeds the field problem.

**Pay particular attention to graded/evaluated SLs during these blocks.** Their ability to teach this material is a leading indicator of whether they'll be able to plan and execute it in the field.

**Thursday afternoon:** After preparation training is complete, issue OPORD 001 to the candidate PL. The PL has the rest of Thursday to conduct TLPs — mission analysis, COA development, and issuing their platoon OPORD to SLs. SLs receive the PL's order Thursday evening and develop their own squad schemes for Friday morning execution. This is the primary PL evaluation event.

| # | Training Task | FLX Relevance |
|---|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Radio Operations and Communications Procedures** — Program FM radios, establish comms on platoon/company nets, conduct radio checks, net calls, and reporting (SALUTE, SITREP, MEDEVAC). | They will run dual-net comms from the COP for the entire FLX. |
| 2 | **OE-254 Antenna Setup and Employment** — Assemble, erect, orient. Grounding, guy-wires, orientation for signal. Maintenance and troubleshooting. | Extended-range comms from COP Seggel back to company (RTI). |
| 3 | **Entry Control Point (ECP) Operations** — Access control, positive ID, vehicle/personnel search, escalation of force, logging all personnel in/out. | ECP is established in OPORD 001 and maintained for the entire FLX. |
| 4 | **Security and Defensive Planning** — Priorities of work, sector sketches, fighting position placement, OP selection, fields of fire, FPF, stand-to, rest/security rotation for 48-hour ops. | Directly tested in OPORD 005 (COP Defense) and every night at the COP. |
| 5 | **Satellite Imagery and Terrain Analysis** — Analyze the COP facility and surrounding terrain. Propose defensive positions, CP location, ECP, CCP, and HLZ. Brief using OAKOC. | Sets up their terrain analysis for every lane. They'll use this product at the COP. |
| 6 | **Battle Tracking and Command Post Operations** — Establish and operate a company CP. Situation maps, unit tracking, comms logs, report processing. Transition from movement to static CP ops. | CP operations are continuous from OPORD 001 through ENDEX. |

## FLX Execution

### Admin Notes

- **DFAC:** Friday 0700. Candidates already have the OPORD (issued Thursday PM) and should have their plan. After chow, draw remaining equipment and SP. Once they cross the LD, they are in a tactical posture.
- **Tactical Posture:** All personnel maintain a tactical posture from crossing the LD until ENDEX. No breaks in the scenario.
- **Class VI:** Candidates are responsible for 48 hours of personal sustainment out of their rucks through movement, clearance, and occupation. No resupply during movement.
- **GSA Van (Sustainment Resupply):** Candidates requested a van for additional water and MREs. Cadre transports to the candidates' requested RP — candidates load and unload. **The van does NOT arrive until the COP is secure.** Candidates must be self-sustaining out of rucks through SP, movement, and COP establishment. Deliver the van once OPORD 001 execution is complete and the position is confirmed secure — this reinforces that sustainment follows tactical conditions, not a schedule. Cadre decides when "secure" means secure.
- **Ammo/Simulators:** No blank ammo or simulators available — Range Control is closed for our training weekend. All engagements are verbal (\"bang bang\") or cadre-adjudicated. OPFOR and candidates call hits. Cadre controls the tempo and outcome of engagements.
- **Medical:** No attached medics. Bring the CLS bag from the supply room in the GSA van. Nearest higher care: HCA Florida Starke Emergency, 922 East Call Street, Starke, FL 32091. All injuries reported to Range Control and Regiment S1.
- **DRAWs:** Must be present at training locations and briefed to all participants. Continuous risk assessment throughout.
- **Admin PACE (Cadre):** Signal (P), Cell (A), Text (C), Runner (E). Senior TAC (CPT Wagner): 813-413-6839 (call/text).
- **Challenge/Password (all weekend):** Viper / Strike / Running: Forward / Combination: 7

### CCIR — Wake-Up Reporting (Immediate)

- Critical illness, serious injury, or death of a Soldier or immediate family member
- Soldier contemplating suicide
- Negligent discharge
- SHARP/EO incident
- Any injuries or medical profiles affecting OCs

### CCIR — Duty Day Reporting

- COMMO outage at any operation area
- Heat index >107°F or wind chill < -18°F
- Loss or damage to equipment
- Major deviation in the published schedule
- Any event likely to be adversely reported by the media

## Cadre Employment Plan

### Roster

| Role | Personnel | Available |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **TAC 1** | CPT Wagner | Thu–Sun |
| **TAC 2** | SFC McLellan | Thu–Sun |
| **TAC 3** | 1LT Walker | Thu–Sun |
| **Tactical Instructor** | SFC Oppegard | Thu–Sun |
| **Infantry Cadre Instructor** | SSG Souza | Fri–Sun |
| **Infantry Cadre Instructor** | SSG Goehrig | Fri–Sun |
| **Senior Instructor** | CPT Kilpatrick | Available as needed |
| **OPFOR (former candidate)** | 1 dropped candidate | Fri–Sun |

### Core Principle: TACs Evaluate, Instructors Enable

TACs own the evaluation mission — they write FLERs. The Infantry Cadre instructors and SFC Oppegard provide tactical depth, OPFOR, and coaching without diluting TAC evaluation focus. TACs do NOT run OPFOR.

### Role Assignments

**3 TACs (Wagner, McLellan, Walker)**
- Friday: Each TAC shadows one of the 3 squads as primary evaluator
- Saturday: 2 TACs follow the 2 maneuver squads, 1 TAC stays at the CP to evaluate the candidate company staff (see Saturday Reorganization below)
- TACs are the primary evaluators — they write FLERs and make lane coaching decisions
- Rotate which TAC evaluates company staff vs. maneuver squads across Saturday lanes

**SFC Oppegard (Tactical Instructor)**
- Friday: Floats between squads during execution to provide tactical coaching *after* the evaluation moment — once the TAC has seen what they need to see, Oppegard coaches the candidate on what to do differently
- Saturday morning: Coaches the candidate company staff through their first order briefs (the easing-in phase) while the TAC evaluates. He's the "experienced XO whispering in the new CO's ear" — helps them get the format right without doing it for them
- Saturday afternoon: Steps back from the candidate staff (independent planning evaluation) and floats between squads during execution
- Safety net role — if a candidate is about to do something genuinely unsafe, Oppegard catches it before it becomes a problem

**2 Infantry Cadre Instructors (SSG Souza, SSG Goehrig)**
- Subject matter experts in infantry tactics, orders, and implementation. Available as tactical references throughout the FLX — candidates and cadre can consult them on tactics, TLP process, and order format. They do NOT write FLERs or manage the candidate staff.
- **Primary role: OPFOR.** They run the enemy for every lane. This is the biggest gap you'd otherwise fill with candidates or TACs.
  - Friday: OPFOR for recon contact (002), OP element (007)
  - Saturday: OPFOR for MTC (008), resupply element (003), courier + escort (009), cache security (004), junction defense (006)
  - 2 instructors is enough for most scenarios. For larger OPFOR needs (junction defense in 006), pull 1-2 candidates from notional COP security or use dropped candidates
- **Secondary role: Tactical injects** — Between OPFOR commitments, simulate higher HQ radio traffic, deliver FRAGOs in character, or act as civilian role players for civil consideration scenarios
- **Tertiary role: Overnight coaching** — One instructor walks the COP perimeter with the security element and coaches defensive operations (sector sketches, range cards, stand-to procedures) while the other rests

**Former Candidate as OPFOR**
- 1 dropped candidate available as additional OPFOR, giving the OPFOR element a 3-person team
- Useful for larger scenarios (deliberate attack, COP defense) and allows the 2 instructors to split roles (e.g., one runs OPFOR while the other resets for the next lane)
- Supervised by the Infantry Cadre instructors at all times
- Does NOT evaluate, coach, or interact with active candidates outside the OPFOR role

**CPT Kilpatrick (Senior Instructor)**
- Available as TAC relief during rest rotations — if a TAC needs a longer break, Kilpatrick covers the evaluation position for a lane
- Extra set of eyes during the Saturday afternoon capstone (006 deliberate attack) when maximum observation on the final evaluation event is valuable
- Not formally tasked — available on request

### Rest/Coverage Plan (48-Hour Ops)

| Time Block | TACs (3) | SFC Oppegard | Infantry Instructors (2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Thu PM** | All 3 — evaluating PL's TLP planning | Coaching as needed | Not yet arrived |
| **Fri AM** | All 3 — COP establishment | Floating tactical coach | Arrive, receive OPFOR brief |
| **Fri PM** | All 3 (1 per squad) | Floating | OPFOR for recon / OP clearance |
| **Fri Night** | 2 on / 1 resting (rotate) | Rest | 1 on (OPFOR probes/noise), 1 rest |
| **Sat AM** | 2 with squads, 1 at CP | Coaching candidate staff | OPFOR for MTC, ambush, intercept |
| **Sat PM** | 2 with squads, 1 at CP | Floating between squads | OPFOR for raid, deliberate attack |
| **Sat Night** | 2 on / 1 resting | Rest | 1 on (overnight OPFOR), 1 rest |
| **Sun AM** | All 3 — AAR and recovery | Supports AAR | Supports AAR, then depart |

## Saturday Reorganization — 2 Squads + Company HQ

On Saturday morning, the 3-squad organization becomes 2 overstrength squads plus a candidate-run Company HQ. Top-performing candidates are elevated to staff roles. See [candidate-company-staff-guide.md](candidate-company-staff-guide.md) for full details.

| Element | Strength | Composition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Company HQ** | 3 candidates | CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO |
| **1st Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |
| **2nd Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |

**Both squads leave the wire every lane.** One squad is main effort, the other is supporting effort (blocking, isolation, screening, security cordon). COP security is notional during Saturday operations. Main effort assignment rotates between squads across the day.

**Order flow on Saturday:** Cadre → Candidate Staff → SLs directly (no separate candidate PL layer). Saturday morning the staff briefs cadre's order with minor refinements. Saturday afternoon the staff plans independently from a mission statement.

---

## The Arc

### Friday — Establish and Orient

**OPORD 001 — "ESTABLISH COP SEGGEL"** *(Thursday brief → Friday execution)*
*Candidate PL receives the OPORD Thursday afternoon*

The company commander issues the base order on Thursday. The candidate PL has Thursday afternoon and evening to conduct full TLPs: mission analysis, COA development, and issue their platoon OPORD to SLs. The order gives only a NLT time to have the COP established with the CP operational — the candidate PL must backwards plan the SP, movement, staging, clearance of the facility, and CP setup.

**Thursday:** Candidate PL receives OPORD 001, conducts TLPs, develops their plan, and briefs SLs. This is the first and biggest PL evaluation — can they take a company OPORD and produce a coherent platoon order with squad assignments? Cadre holds the detailed squad overlay ([013-establish-cop-detailed.md](013-establish-cop-detailed.md)) as a safety net. If the PL's order is weak, TAC can coach/redirect before Friday execution.

**Friday:** DFAC breakfast at 0700. SP shortly after chow — candidates must be moving early to meet the NLT. 1st Platoon moves tactically from the RTI through two checkpoints (CP ANVIL and CP FORGE) to COP Seggel. They clear the facility, establish perimeter security and the ECP, stand up the company CP, and prepare defensive positions. **COP established with CP operational NLT early afternoon Friday** — this gives time for OPORD 002 in the afternoon.

Use the movement phase to evaluate basic competence: formations, movement techniques, security halts, danger area crossings. The clearing and occupation phase evaluates the SL's ability to transition from movement to offense to defense.

*Expected duration: 3-4 hours including movement (0730ish SP → ~1200 COP established)*

**GSA Van delivery:** Once the COP is secure (perimeter established, ECP operational, facility cleared), cadre delivers the GSA van to the candidates' requested RP. Candidates unload their additional water and MREs. This is the sustainment transition — they've been on rucks since SP.

**Chow/Rest:** Hot chow (MRE) and water resupply upon COP establishment. 30-minute rest rotation before issuing OPORD 002.

---

**OPORD 002 — "MAP THE AO"** *(Area Reconnaissance, ~1300–1500)*
*Issued from COP Seggel once occupation is complete*

The cadre (as PL) needs to know what's around us. The evaluated SL receives the order and must plan a reconnaissance of two Named Areas of Interest: NAI 1 (Jacksonville Street corridor, MP 0602 1565) and NAI 2 (western woodlines / Clearwater Ave corridor, MP 0575 1538). The SL has to decide how to organize recon elements and COP security with the personnel available.

**Cadre focus:** Recon planning, stealth, reporting discipline, balancing recon effort with COP security. The SL who sends everyone out and leaves the COP exposed is wrong. The SL who keeps too many back and sends a token patrol is playing it too safe. Look for the balance.

**OPFOR:** REAPER observation posts in both NAIs. They observe and withdraw — do not engage the recon patrols. If a patrol is loud or sloppy, have REAPER shadow them and report. This feeds the narrative: REAPER now knows we're patrolling.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation (MRE) after recon teams return. Debrief recon findings before issuing FRAGO 007.

---

**FRAGO 007 — "CLEAR THE OP"** *(~1530–1730)*
*FRAGO issued at COP Seggel — reference OPORD 001*

Recon patrols report a suspected REAPER observation post in a structure approximately 200 meters west of COP Seggel (vicinity MP 0580 1550). The OP has line of sight to the COP's western perimeter and the ECP. It is actively reporting our defensive layout and patrol patterns to REAPER higher. This is time-sensitive — clear it before dark.

This is the first FRAGO in the FLX. The evaluated SL receives abbreviated information and must plan rapidly from less detail than a full OPORD. Tests transition from "we just got back from recon" to "you need to go back out right now."

**Cadre focus:** Rapid planning from fragmentary information. The SL gets a FRAGO, not a full OPORD — they have to fill in the gaps themselves. Evaluate how they handle the compressed timeline while still producing a coherent plan. Watch for the SL who rushes out without a plan versus the one who plans too long and loses the daylight window.

**OPFOR:** 2-3 REAPER at the OP with radio and observation equipment. They are monitoring, not fighting — attempt withdrawal when detected. If the SL's approach is stealthy, REAPER doesn't detect them until it's too late. If the approach is loud, REAPER withdraws and the SL finds an empty position with abandoned equipment.

*Expected duration: 2 hours (last light 1854 — creates natural time pressure)*

---

### Friday Night — COP Operations

No formal lanes overnight. The candidates run the COP: security rotation, rest plan, CP operations, radio watch. This is where you evaluate candidates on sustainment, battle tracking, and managing the rest/security balance.

**Chow/Rest:** Evening MRE rotation after FRAGO 007 is complete. Enforce a rest plan — candidates must sleep in shifts. Cadre should verify the SL has a written rest/security roster.

**Inject options:**
- REAPER probe of the perimeter (small element, breaks contact quickly)
- Noise or movement in the woodlines triggering a stand-to
- Civilian approaching the ECP at night
- FRAGO from company requesting a SITREP or LACE report
- Simulated indirect fire (one or two rounds) to test overhead cover and dispersion

None of these need to be full lanes. They're short-duration events that keep candidates engaged and create evaluation moments. **Keep overnight injects manageable — candidates need some rest for the heavy Saturday schedule.**

---

### Saturday — Full Operations Tempo

**Before the first lane:** Execute the Saturday reorganization (see above and [candidate-company-staff-guide.md](candidate-company-staff-guide.md)). Select 3 top performers for Company HQ. Reorganize remaining candidates into 2 squads of 11. Brief the candidate staff on their roles and the morning order flow.

**OPORD 008 — "FIRST LIGHT"** *(Movement to Contact, ~0600–0800)*
*Issued at COP Seggel — triggers at first light (0623)*

Overnight security observed REAPER movement in the woodlines north and northwest of COP Seggel. OP/LPs reported foot traffic, low-light signals, and radio transmissions. At least one REAPER probe was detected and repelled. REAPER is massing or repositioning — 1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact at first light to locate and engage.

This is the early kickoff lane. The SL receives the order during the pre-dawn hours and must plan under fatigue after overnight security operations. The dawn timing creates limited visibility conditions and tests candidates who are tired — that's the point.

**Cadre focus:** Planning under fatigue. Movement technique selection (bounding overwatch in limited visibility). Developing the situation — does the SL commit everything on first contact or assess first? Does the SL maintain COP security while pushing the MTC element forward? Limit of advance is Jacksonville Street — does the SL track this?

**OPFOR:** Squad-sized REAPER element (6-8) in the woodlines between COP Seggel and Jacksonville Street. MPCOA: REAPER breaks contact and withdraws north upon detecting the advance. MDCOA: REAPER has set a hasty ambush along a likely patrol route. Scale to the candidate — a strong SL gets the ambush, a struggling SL gets the withdrawal.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** Hot chow rotation (MRE) after MTC element returns to COP. 45-minute rest/refit before issuing OPORD 003. Cadre uses this time to assess COP status and prepare for the ambush lane.

---

**OPORD 003 — "CUT THE LINE"** *(Ambush, ~0900–1100)*
*Issued at COP Seggel*

Recon from OPORD 002 identified a REAPER resupply route along Bradenton Avenue. Intel indicates regular supply runs moving north past MP 0600 1530. The company commander orders an ambush to cut the supply line and capture intelligence.

The SL must plan: ORP, ambush site, kill zone, assault/support/security, withdrawal route back to COP, and who stays behind to hold the COP. The critical planning challenge is the departure from and return to the COP — link-up procedures, recognition signals, and avoiding fratricide with the COP garrison.

**Cadre focus:** Ambush site selection, kill zone orientation, initiation criteria (what if civilians are in the kill zone?), speed on the objective, withdrawal discipline. Evaluate the SL's plan for time on objective — if they're spending 20 minutes searching, they're wrong.

**OPFOR:** REAPER supply element of 3-5 personnel with a lead scout. Play the scout 50-100 meters ahead. If the ambush is poorly set, have the scout detect it and the element withdraw. If it's well set, walk into the kill zone. After the ambush, have REAPER "react" by sending a patrol from the south 15-20 minutes later (this pressures the withdrawal timeline).

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation after return to COP. Brief refit before FRAGO 009.

---

**FRAGO 009 — "SNARE"** *(Intercept Courier, ~1130–1330)*
*FRAGO issued at COP Seggel — reference OPORD 001*

Documents recovered during the raid on the REAPER weapons cache (OPORD 004 — *yes, the narrative is slightly out of sequence here; brief it as "documents recovered during the ambush" or simply as "new intelligence"*) indicate a REAPER courier carrying orders from higher command is expected to transit through the Clearwater Avenue corridor (vicinity MP 0575 1538) within 2 hours. Capture the courier and recover the communications.

This is the second FRAGO. The SL must plan and execute rapidly within a 2-hour window. The mission emphasizes capture over kill — the documents are the priority. Tests the SL's ability to set up a hasty intercept with minimal planning time.

**Cadre focus:** Speed of planning — the 2-hour courier window creates real time pressure. Does the SL set up a proper intercept (blocking positions, capture team) or just run out and hope? Balance between intercept force and COP security. Handling of the capture — do they secure the documents immediately or get caught up in detainee procedures?

**OPFOR:** 1 courier + 1 escort, both armed with small arms. Traveling light and fast. If confronted, the escort delays while the courier escapes with documents. If capture is imminent, the courier attempts to destroy documents. Scale: if the SL's intercept is well-planned, the courier walks into it. If poorly planned, the escort spots them and the courier runs — allow a brief pursuit but don't let it spiral into a long chase.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** Extended 1-hour chow and rest rotation (~1330-1430). This is the midday break. Candidates eat, refit, and rest before the afternoon's heavy operations. Cadre uses this time to set up the raid objective and brief OPFOR.

---

**OPORD 004 — "IRON STRIKE"** *(Raid, ~1430–1630)*
*Issued at COP Seggel*

Documents captured in the ambush reveal a REAPER weapons cache at MP 0611 1530 (east of the COP). The cadre (as PL) orders a raid to destroy the cache. This is the most complex offensive operation in the FLX — the SL must plan an ORP, leader's recon, assault, site exploitation (search and collect intel before destroying), and withdrawal, all while maintaining COP security.

**Cadre focus:** ORP selection, leader's recon plan, assault plan, time management on the objective (search THEN destroy — not the other way around), withdrawal route selection (different from approach), and COP security plan. The two key evaluation points: (1) Does the SL plan for the possibility that REAPER reinforced the cache after losing the supply element? (2) Does the SL set a time limit on the objective?

**OPFOR:** 3-5 REAPER at the cache in a low-profile security posture. Scale resistance to the candidate — a strong SL gets a fight, a struggling SL gets a REAPER element that withdraws on contact. After the raid, regardless of outcome, REAPER consolidates north — this sets up OPORD 006.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation after return to COP. Brief candidates that REAPER is consolidating at the Jacksonville Street junction.

---

**OPORD 006 — "FINAL ANVIL"** *(Deliberate Attack, ~1700–1900)*
*Issued at COP Seggel*

REAPER's remaining forces have consolidated at the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction (MP 0602 1565) — 150 meters north of the COP. The company commander orders 1st Platoon to seize the junction and finish REAPER in AO HERRERA. This is the capstone: a short-range deliberate attack from an established base against a known, degraded enemy position. **Last light is 1855 — this creates natural time pressure to complete the attack before dark.**

**Cadre focus:** SBF position selection, assault route (do NOT go straight up Bradenton Ave), security/blocking positions on Jacksonville St to prevent escape, consolidation on the objective. The proximity to the COP (150m) is a planning factor — the SL must still plan this properly, not just "run up the road."

**OPFOR:** 6-10 REAPER in hasty positions at the junction, oriented south. Low ammo, low morale. They fight but break when pressed. If the SL's plan is solid, REAPER collapses quickly. If the plan is poor (frontal assault up Bradenton), REAPER holds and inflicts casualties.

*Expected duration: 1.5-2 hours (complete before last light 1855)*

---

### Saturday Night — Transition to Rest

After the deliberate attack, consolidate back at COP Seggel. Hot chow (MRE), water resupply. Maintain COP security with a rest/security rotation. Brief candidates that AO HERRERA is effectively cleared but residual REAPER elements may attempt a spoiling attack overnight.

**Overnight inject options (keep light — candidates are exhausted):**
- Single REAPER probe testing the perimeter (evaluates alert status)
- Company FRAGO requesting an updated SITREP and ACE/LACE
- Simulated indirect fire (one round) to test stand-to procedures

**Priority is rest.** Saturday is the heaviest day of the FLX. Candidates need sleep before Sunday.

---

### Sunday Morning — ENDEX

**OPORD 005 — "HOLD THE LINE"** *(COP Defense — OPTIONAL)*
*Triggered at stand-to if cadre chooses to execute*

If cadre wants a final evaluation opportunity, trigger a REAPER counterattack on the COP at first light (0722 EDT — note time change). This is optional — execute only if there are candidates who still need an evaluated lane or if the defense looks like it needs testing.

**If executed:** REAPER attacks from the north along Bradenton Ave with a supporting attack from the west through the woodlines. Open with simulated indirect fire (2-3 minutes), then assault. Keep the attack to 15-20 minutes — this is a bookend, not a marathon.

**OPFOR:** Scale to available OPFOR and energy level. A short, sharp attack that tests the overnight defensive preparations. If positions are good, the defense succeeds quickly. If sloppy, REAPER penetrates and creates a decision point.

**If not executed:** Move directly to ENDEX procedures after morning stand-to.

---

**ENDEX and Recovery** *(~0800–1100 EDT)*

- ENDEX called after optional defense or at cadre's discretion
- Transition from tactical to administrative posture
- Police call of all training areas, COP, objective sites
- Weapons/equipment accountability and turn-in
- Blank ammo accountability
- AAR — structured hot wash by lane, then overall FLX AAR
- Equipment turn-in to Range Control
- Depart CBJTC

This schedule supports up to 9 evaluated SL rotations (8 required + 1 optional). Adjust candidate assignments based on class size. If you have more candidates than lanes, double up — evaluate two candidates simultaneously (e.g., SL and a team leader with specific tasks). If you have fewer, drop the optional Sunday defense and consolidate.

---

## Evaluation Notes

**What the arc tests that individual STX lanes don't:**
- Planning from an established base (not a cold start at an AA)
- Departure from and return to a friendly position (link-up, recognition, fratricide prevention)
- Cumulative effects of decisions (poor COP setup makes the defense harder)
- Sustained operations under fatigue (Saturday dawn MTC — candidates are tired from overnight, that's the point)
- Rapid planning from FRAGOs with incomplete information (007, 009)
- CP operations and battle tracking as a continuous activity, not a one-time setup
- Direct application of Thursday's preparation training (radios, ECP, CP ops, defensive planning)
- Time-pressure decision making (courier window, last-light deadlines)

**Thursday training → FLX connection:** Watch whether the SL who taught defensive planning actually applies it at the COP. Watch whether the candidate who taught ECP ops runs a sloppy ECP. The preparation training is their chance to study the material — the FLX is the test.

**Common candidate failures to watch for:**
- Leaving the COP undefended while conducting offensive operations
- No plan for link-up / re-entry to the COP after patrols
- No time limit on the objective during the raid
- Defensive positions with no overhead cover or gaps in sectors of fire
- Failing to coordinate with adjacent elements or report to higher (cadre as PL)
- No rest plan — running everyone into the ground by Saturday afternoon
- Freezing on FRAGOs — spending too long planning when the situation demands speed
- Treating the courier intercept as a patrol instead of setting a deliberate blocking position
