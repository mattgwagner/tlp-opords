# FLX Cadre Brief — March 2026

**CADRE USE ONLY — DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES**

**Operation SPRING STRIKE — Class 065 Culmination FLX**
05-08 March 2026 | CBJTC, Starke, FL

---

## Weekend Overview

This is the culmination Field Leadership Exercise for Class 065 — a 48-hour field problem at Camp Blanding built around a single continuous narrative. 1st Platoon moves to, occupies, and operates from Combat Outpost Seggel in AO HERRERA. Every mission flows from the one before it: recon finds the enemy, the FRAGO sends a squad to clear them, captured intel leads to an ambush, the ambush produces documents that trigger a raid, and so on through a capstone deliberate attack Saturday evening. Nine lanes total (six full OPORDs, three FRAGOs).

**The exercise runs in two phases with different evaluation models:**

**Friday (3 squads):** Cadre acts as the platoon leader and issues orders directly to three squad leaders. All three SLs are evaluated simultaneously — each TAC shadows one squad. The PL candidate is evaluated on Thursday (receiving and issuing OPORD 001) and continuously on COP management throughout.

**Saturday (2 squads + candidate company staff):** Friday evening, cadre selects three top-performing candidates for company staff roles (CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO) and reorganizes from three squads into two overstrength squads. The order flow becomes **Cadre → Candidate Staff → SLs**. Cadre gives the staff a platoon-level order; the staff develops squad taskings (main effort / supporting effort, task and purpose for each squad, coordination); the SLs then plan their squad's execution independently (route, fire team tasks, actions on OBJ, sand table). The staff says WHAT each squad does — the SLs plan HOW. Staff independence increases across the day: the first lane they get a full OPORD with coaching, by the capstone they receive only a mission statement and plan the entire order from scratch.

**Both squads leave the wire every Saturday lane** — one main effort, one supporting. SLs rotate each mission. PL/PSG resume command of the COP between lanes and are evaluated continuously. The candidate staff is evaluated on every Saturday lane. TACs evaluate multiple candidates simultaneously throughout.

## Thursday — FLX Preparation Training + OPORD 001 Issue

The student chain of command selects candidates to prepare and deliver training on the tasks below. **All rated squad leaders will lead at least one of these training sessions.** This is an evaluated event — assess preparation quality, delivery, and demonstrated knowledge. These are also the skills they'll need to execute the FLX, so the training directly feeds the field problem.

**Pay particular attention to graded/evaluated SLs during these blocks.** Their ability to teach this material is a leading indicator of whether they'll be able to plan and execute it in the field.

**Thursday afternoon:** After preparation training is complete, issue OPORD 001 to the candidate PL. The PL has the rest of Thursday to conduct TLPs — mission analysis, COA development, and issuing their platoon OPORD to SLs. SLs receive the PL's order Thursday evening and develop their own squad schemes for Friday morning execution. This is the primary PL evaluation event.

| # | Training Task | FLX Relevance |
|---|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Radio Operations and Communications Procedures** — Program FM radios, establish comms on platoon/company nets, conduct radio checks, net calls, and reporting (SALUTE, SITREP, MEDEVAC). | They will run dual-net comms from the COP for the entire FLX. |
| 2 | **OE-254 Antenna Setup and Employment** — Assemble, erect, orient. Grounding, guy-wires, orientation for signal. Maintenance and troubleshooting. | Extended-range comms from COP Seggel back to company (RTI). |
| 3 | **Entry Control Point (ECP) Operations** — Access control, positive ID, vehicle/personnel search, escalation of force, logging all personnel in/out. | ECP is established in OPORD 001 and maintained for the entire FLX. |
| 4 | **Security and Defensive Planning** — Priorities of work, sector sketches, fighting position placement, OP selection, fields of fire, FPF, stand-to, rest/security rotation for 48-hour ops. | Directly tested in OPORD 005 (COP Defense) and every night at the COP. |
| 5 | **Satellite Imagery and Terrain Analysis** — Analyze the COP facility and surrounding terrain. Propose defensive positions, CP location, ECP, CCP, and HLZ. Brief using OAKOC. | Sets up their terrain analysis for every lane. They'll use this product at the COP. |
| 6 | **Battle Tracking and Command Post Operations** — Establish and operate a company CP. Situation maps, unit tracking, comms logs, report processing. Transition from movement to static CP ops. | CP operations are continuous from OPORD 001 through ENDEX. |

## FLX Execution

### Admin Notes

- **DFAC:** Friday 0700. Candidates already have the OPORD (issued Thursday PM) and should have their plan. After chow, draw remaining equipment and SP. Once they cross the LD, they are in a tactical posture.
- **Tactical Posture:** All personnel maintain a tactical posture from crossing the LD until ENDEX. No breaks in the scenario.
- **Class VI:** Candidates are responsible for 48 hours of personal sustainment out of their rucks through movement, clearance, and occupation. No resupply during movement.
- **GSA Van (Sustainment Resupply):** Candidates requested a van for additional water and MREs. Cadre transports to the candidates' requested RP — candidates load and unload. **The van does NOT arrive until the COP is secure.** Candidates must be self-sustaining out of rucks through SP, movement, and COP establishment. Deliver the van once OPORD 001 execution is complete and the position is confirmed secure — this reinforces that sustainment follows tactical conditions, not a schedule. Cadre decides when "secure" means secure.
- **Ammo/Simulators:** No blank ammo or simulators available — Range Control is closed for our training weekend. All engagements are verbal (\"bang bang\") or cadre-adjudicated. OPFOR and candidates call hits. Cadre controls the tempo and outcome of engagements.
- **Medical:** No attached medics. Bring the CLS bag from the supply room in the GSA van. Nearest higher care: HCA Florida Starke Emergency, 922 East Call Street, Starke, FL 32091. All injuries reported to Range Control and Regiment S1.
- **DRAWs:** Must be present at training locations and briefed to all participants. Continuous risk assessment throughout.
- **Admin PACE (Cadre):** Signal (P), Cell (A), Text (C), Runner (E). Senior TAC (CPT Wagner): 813-413-6839 (call/text).
- **Challenge/Password (all weekend):** Viper / Strike / Running: Forward / Combination: 7

### CCIR — Wake-Up Reporting (Immediate)

- Critical illness, serious injury, or death of a Soldier or immediate family member
- Soldier contemplating suicide
- Negligent discharge
- SHARP/EO incident
- Any injuries or medical profiles affecting OCs

### CCIR — Duty Day Reporting

- COMMO outage at any operation area
- Heat index >107°F or wind chill < -18°F
- Loss or damage to equipment
- Major deviation in the published schedule
- Any event likely to be adversely reported by the media

## Cadre Employment Plan

### Core Principle: TACs Evaluate, Instructors Enable

TACs own the evaluation mission — they write FLERs. The Infantry Cadre instructors and SFC Oppegard provide tactical depth, OPFOR, and coaching without diluting TAC evaluation focus. TACs do NOT run OPFOR.

### Role Assignments

**3 TACs (Wagner, McLellan, Walker)**
- Friday: Each TAC shadows one of the 3 squads as primary evaluator
- Saturday: CPT Wagner manages and evaluates the candidate company staff from the CP. SFC McLellan and 1LT Walker each follow one of the 2 maneuver squads as primary evaluators
- TACs are the primary evaluators — they write FLERs and make lane coaching decisions

**SFC Oppegard (Tactical Instructor)**
- Friday: Floats between squads during execution to provide tactical coaching *after* the evaluation moment — once the TAC has seen what they need to see, Oppegard coaches the candidate on what to do differently
- Saturday: Sits in on order briefs (both candidate staff briefs to SLs and SL briefs to their squads) and critiques the tactical content — scheme of maneuver, task organization, fire control measures, actions on the objective. Focuses on whether the plan is tactically sound, not just formatted correctly
- Walks lanes with TACs to observe and provide feedback on tactical execution — movement techniques, use of terrain, fire and maneuver, security
- Available to talk tactics with candidates between lanes — "here's how I'd approach that ambush site," "let me walk you through why your SBF position didn't have the right fields of fire"
- Safety net role — if a candidate is about to do something genuinely unsafe, Oppegard catches it before it becomes a problem

**2 Infantry Cadre Instructors (SSG Souza, SSG Goehrig)**
- Subject matter experts in infantry tactics, orders, and implementation. Available as tactical references throughout the FLX — candidates and cadre can consult them on tactics, TLP process, and order format. They do NOT write FLERs or manage the candidate staff.
- **Split duties each lane: one runs OPFOR, the other walks the lane.** Alternate roles between lanes so both get time on each side.

**Lane Walker Role (1 instructor per lane):**
- Walks the lane alongside the TAC, observing tactical execution — formations, movement techniques, security, fire and maneuver, actions on the objective
- During planning: sits in on the candidate's TLP/order brief and evaluates the tactical quality of the plan with the TAC. Two sets of eyes on whether the scheme of maneuver makes sense before candidates step off
- During execution: provides real-time tactical feedback to the TAC on what they're seeing — "that flank is exposed," "they forgot rear security," "good use of terrain on the approach"
- After the lane: delivers a tactical debrief to candidates alongside the TAC — what worked, what didn't, what doctrine says. The TAC handles the leadership evaluation; the instructor handles the tactical critique
- This gives candidates feedback from an infantry SME perspective that complements the TAC's leadership evaluation

**OPFOR Role (1 instructor per lane + former candidate):**
- Runs the enemy for the current lane with the former candidate as the second OPFOR body
  - Friday: OPFOR for recon contact (002), OP element (007)
  - Saturday: OPFOR for MTC (008), resupply element (003), courier + escort (009), cache security (004), junction defense (006)
  - For larger OPFOR needs (junction defense in 006), both instructors may need to run OPFOR — the lane walker role takes a backseat for that lane
- Between OPFOR commitments: simulate higher HQ radio traffic, deliver FRAGOs in character, or act as civilian role players

**Overnight:** One instructor walks the COP perimeter with the security element and coaches defensive operations (sector sketches, range cards, stand-to procedures) while the other rests

**Former Candidate as OPFOR**
- 1 dropped candidate available as additional OPFOR, giving the OPFOR element a 3-person team
- Useful for larger scenarios (deliberate attack, COP defense) and allows the 2 instructors to split roles (e.g., one runs OPFOR while the other resets for the next lane)
- Supervised by the Infantry Cadre instructors at all times
- Does NOT evaluate, coach, or interact with active candidates outside the OPFOR role

**CPT Kilpatrick (Senior Instructor)**
- Available as TAC relief during rest rotations — if a TAC needs a longer break, Kilpatrick covers the evaluation position for a lane
- Extra set of eyes during the Saturday afternoon capstone (006 deliberate attack) when maximum observation on the final evaluation event is valuable
- Not formally tasked — available on request

### Rest/Coverage Plan (48-Hour Ops)

## The Arc

### Friday — Establish and Orient

**[OPORD 001 — "ESTABLISH COP SEGGEL"](001-establish-cop.html)** *(Thursday brief → Friday execution)*
*Candidate PL receives the OPORD Thursday afternoon*

The company commander issues the base order on Thursday. The candidate PL has Thursday afternoon and evening to conduct full TLPs: mission analysis, COA development, and issue their platoon OPORD to SLs. The order gives only a NLT time to have the COP established with the CP operational — the candidate PL must backwards plan the SP, movement, staging, clearance of the facility, and CP setup.

**Thursday:** Candidate PL receives OPORD 001, conducts TLPs, develops their plan, and briefs SLs. This is the first and biggest PL evaluation — can they take a company OPORD and produce a coherent platoon order with squad assignments? Cadre holds the detailed squad overlay ([013-establish-cop-detailed](013-establish-cop-detailed.html)) as a safety net. If the PL's order is weak, TAC can coach/redirect before Friday execution.

**Friday:** DFAC breakfast at 0700. SP shortly after chow — candidates must be moving early to meet the NLT. 1st Platoon moves tactically from the RTI through three checkpoints (CP ANVIL, CP FORGE, and CP HAMMER) to COP Seggel. They clear the facility, establish perimeter security and the ECP, stand up the company CP, and prepare defensive positions. **COP established with CP operational NLT 1300** — this gives time for OPORD 002 in the afternoon.

Use the movement phase to evaluate basic competence: formations, movement techniques, security halts, danger area crossings. The clearing and occupation phase evaluates the SL's ability to transition from movement to offense to defense.

*Expected duration: 3-4 hours including movement (0730ish SP → COP established NLT 1300)*

**GSA Van delivery:** Once the COP is secure (perimeter established, ECP operational, facility cleared), cadre delivers the GSA van to the candidates' requested RP. Candidates unload their additional water and MREs. This is the sustainment transition — they've been on rucks since SP.

**Chow/Rest:** Chow (MRE) and water resupply upon COP establishment. 30-minute rest rotation before issuing OPORD 002.

---

**[OPORD 002 — "MAP THE AO"](002-area-reconnaissance.html)** *(Area Reconnaissance, ~1300–1500)*
*Issued from COP Seggel once occupation is complete*

The cadre (as PL) briefs the platoon order to all three SLs: the platoon needs to reconnoiter two NAIs while maintaining COP security. 1st Squad gets NAI 1 (Jacksonville Street corridor, MP 0602 1565). 2nd Squad gets NAI 2 (western woodlines / Clearwater Ave corridor, MP 0575 1538). 3rd Squad has COP security — ECP, perimeter, CP operations, and QRF. Each SL then plans how their squad executes their assigned task: patrol composition, routes, formations, actions on contact, rally points, reporting plan, timeline.

**Cadre focus:** All three SLs are evaluated simultaneously on their planning and execution. Recon SLs: patrol planning, stealth, reporting discipline, actions on the objective. COP security SL: maintaining the defense, tracking recon elements, running the QRF. Each TAC shadows one squad.

**OPFOR:** REAPER observation posts in both NAIs. They observe and withdraw — do not engage the recon patrols. If a patrol is loud or sloppy, have REAPER shadow them and report. This feeds the narrative: REAPER now knows we're patrolling.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation (MRE) after recon teams return. Debrief recon findings before issuing FRAGO 007.

---

**[FRAGO 007 — "CLEAR THE OP"](007-frago-clear-reaper-op.html)** *(~1530–1730)*
*FRAGO issued at COP Seggel — reference OPORD 001*

Recon patrols report a suspected REAPER observation post in a structure approximately 200 meters west of COP Seggel (vicinity MP 0580 1550). The OP has line of sight to the COP's western perimeter and the ECP. It is actively reporting our defensive layout and patrol patterns to REAPER higher. This is time-sensitive — clear it before dark.

This is the first FRAGO in the FLX. 3rd Squad gets the mission — they've been on COP security while 1st and 2nd Squads were out on recon, so they're fresh and it's their turn outside the wire. The 3rd SL receives abbreviated information and must plan rapidly from less detail than a full OPORD. Tests transition from "holding the COP" to "you need to go out right now."

**Cadre focus:** Rapid planning from fragmentary information. The SL gets a FRAGO, not a full OPORD — they have to fill in the gaps themselves. Evaluate how they handle the compressed timeline while still producing a coherent plan. Watch for the SL who rushes out without a plan versus the one who plans too long and loses the daylight window. 1st and 2nd SLs take over COP security — minor evaluation on their ability to absorb the defense from 3rd Squad.

**OPFOR:** 2-3 REAPER at the OP with radio and observation equipment. They are monitoring, not fighting — attempt withdrawal when detected. If the SL's approach is stealthy, REAPER doesn't detect them until it's too late. If the approach is loud, REAPER withdraws and the SL finds an empty position with abandoned equipment.

*Expected duration: 2 hours (last light 1854 — creates natural time pressure)*

---

### Friday Evening — Reorganization and Transition

**~1730 (after FRAGO 007):** Evening chow (MRE). During this transition, cadre announces the Saturday reorganization:
- 3 squads become 2 overstrength squads + a candidate-run Company HQ
- Name the 3 candidates selected for staff roles (CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO)
- Candidates reorganize into new squads

**Candidate staff standup:** CPT Wagner briefs the candidate staff on their roles, the order flow, and expectations. Issue OPORD 008 to the candidate staff Friday evening so they can absorb it, prep their brief, and be ready to deliver it to SLs at Saturday stand-down. This is their first test — can they turn a company order into a coherent brief overnight?

**Candidate PL/PSG resume command for overnight operations.** With the staff now in place, the candidate PL and PSG are back in the rated chain running the COP: they own the security/rest rotation, CP operations, and radio watch. The candidate staff (CO, XO, Battle Captain) integrates alongside them — the Battle Captain helps with battle tracking, the XO manages the sustainment plan. This is continuous evaluation of the rated chain outside of formal lanes.

**Between lanes on Saturday:** same principle. When a lane isn't running, the PL/PSG are in command managing the COP. They step aside only when a specific SL evaluation lane kicks off, then resume when elements return. The PL/PSG are always being evaluated on COP management, even if they're not the primary evaluation target for a given lane.

### Friday Night — COP Operations

No formal lanes overnight. The candidates run the COP under the reorganized structure: PL/PSG in command, candidate staff at the CP, security rotation, rest plan, radio watch. This is where you evaluate candidates on sustainment, battle tracking, and managing the rest/security balance.

**Enforce a rest plan** — candidates must sleep in shifts. Cadre should verify the PL/PSG has a written rest/security roster that accounts for the new 2-squad structure.

**Inject options:**
- REAPER probe of the perimeter (small element, breaks contact quickly)
- Noise or movement in the woodlines triggering a stand-to
- Civilian approaching the ECP at night
- FRAGO from company requesting a SITREP or LACE report
- Simulated indirect fire (one or two rounds) to test overhead cover and dispersion

None of these need to be full lanes. They're short-duration events that keep candidates engaged and create evaluation moments. **Keep overnight injects manageable — candidates need some rest for the heavy Saturday schedule.**

---

### Saturday — Full Operations Tempo

#### Saturday Force Structure — 2 Squads + Company HQ

The reorganization was announced and executed Friday evening. By Saturday morning, the new structure is in place and the candidate staff already has OPORD 008. See [Candidate Company Staff Guide](candidate-company-staff-guide.html) for full details on staff roles and selection criteria.

| Element | Strength | Composition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Company HQ** | 3 candidates | CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO |
| **1st Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |
| **2nd Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |

**Both squads leave the wire every lane.** One squad is main effort, the other is supporting effort (blocking, isolation, screening, security cordon). COP security is notional during Saturday operations. Main effort assignment rotates between squads across the day.

**Order flow on Saturday:** Cadre → Candidate Staff → SLs directly (no separate candidate PL layer). Progressive scaffolding — staff independence increases across the day:

| Lane | Staff receives order... | Detail level | Staff responsibility |
|------|------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 008 MTC | Friday evening | Platoon-level OPORD | Develop squad taskings overnight, brief SLs at stand-down |
| 003 Ambush | During MTC execution | Platoon-level OPORD | Develop squad taskings, brief SLs at chow/rest |
| 009 Intercept | During ambush execution | FRAGO (abbreviated) | Develop squad taskings from less information |
| 004 Raid | During intercept execution | Platoon-level OPORD | Develop squad taskings (should be faster by now) |
| 006 Deliberate Attack | During raid execution | **Mission statement only** | **Plan entire order independently (capstone)** |

**Staff vs. SL planning boundary:** The staff says WHAT each squad does. The SL plans HOW. Specifically:

- **Staff provides:** Task and purpose for each squad, main/supporting effort designation, coordination between squads (boundaries, phase lines, signals), timeline.
- **SLs plan independently:** Route selection, movement technique, fire team task organization, actions on the objective (their squad's piece), ORP/rally points, contingency plans, sand table rehearsal.

This is where the SL evaluation lives — the TLP from squad task receipt through execution. If the candidate CO starts briefing fire team assignments or dictating squad-internal movement, cadre redirects: *"CO, that's the SL's plan — give them their task and purpose and let them figure out how."* This applies to every Saturday lane, including the capstone.

**Saturday morning sequence:**

1. **~0600 Stand-to at BMNT.** Candidates are already doing this from overnight security rotation.
2. **~0630 Stand down.** Candidate staff briefs OPORD 008 to SLs — their first order delivery under the new structure.
3. **~0630–0800 SL planning.** SLs conduct TLPs over chow (MRE) — mission analysis, scheme of maneuver, sand table, brief their squads. ~1.5 hours of planning time.
4. **~0800 SP for MTC.**

**[OPORD 008 — "FIRST LIGHT"](008-movement-to-contact.html)** *(Movement to Contact, ~0800–1000)*
*Staff briefed Friday night, candidate staff briefs SLs at Saturday stand-down*

Overnight security observed REAPER movement in the woodlines north and northwest of COP Seggel. OP/LPs reported foot traffic, low-light signals, and radio transmissions. At least one REAPER probe was detected and repelled. REAPER is massing or repositioning — the company commander orders 1st Platoon to conduct a movement to contact to locate and engage.

The OPORD is platoon-level only — it does NOT assign squad tasks. The candidate staff received it Friday evening and had overnight to develop their plan: which squad advances, which screens, routes, fire control measures, actions on contact. This is the staff evaluation — can they turn a platoon order into a coherent scheme of maneuver with squad taskings and brief it to SLs? SLs then get ~1.5 hours for their own TLPs after receiving the staff's brief at stand-down.

Candidates are tired from overnight security operations — that's the point. But they plan and brief in daylight with a meal in them, which is realistic.

**Cadre focus:** Two evaluations running simultaneously. (1) Candidate staff: did they develop a sound scheme of maneuver with appropriate squad taskings? Can they answer SL questions? Did they think about the limit of advance (Jacksonville Street)? (2) SLs: planning under fatigue — movement technique selection, developing the situation. Does the SL commit everything on first contact or assess first? Cadre holds a detailed squad overlay as a safety net — if the staff's plan is weak, TAC can redirect before execution.

**OPFOR:** Squad-sized REAPER element (6-8) in the woodlines between COP Seggel and Jacksonville Street. MPCOA: REAPER breaks contact and withdraws north upon detecting the advance. MDCOA: REAPER has set a hasty ambush along a likely patrol route. Scale to the candidate — a strong SL gets the ambush, a struggling SL gets the withdrawal.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** Chow rotation (MRE) after MTC element returns to COP. 45-minute rest/refit before issuing OPORD 003. Cadre uses this time to assess COP status and prepare for the ambush lane.

---

**[OPORD 003 — "CUT THE LINE"](003-ambush.html)** *(Ambush, ~1030–1230)*
*Staff receives order during MTC execution (~0900). Staff briefs SLs at chow/rest.*

Recon from OPORD 002 identified a REAPER resupply route along Bradenton Avenue. Intel indicates regular supply runs moving north past MP 0600 1530. The company commander orders an ambush to cut the supply line and capture intelligence.

The OPORD is platoon-level only — no squad tasks assigned. The candidate staff receives the order while the MTC is still running, develops squad taskings (who is the ambush element, who blocks, withdrawal plan), and briefs SLs during the chow/rest period. SLs then plan their squad schemes: ORP, ambush site, kill zone, assault/support/security, withdrawal route. The critical planning challenge is the departure from and return to the COP — link-up procedures, recognition signals, and avoiding fratricide.

**Cadre focus:** Three evaluations. (1) Staff: developing squad taskings from a platoon-level order while the previous lane is still running — can they multitask? (2) SL plan: ambush site selection, kill zone orientation, initiation criteria (what if civilians are in the kill zone?), speed on the objective, withdrawal discipline. (3) Time on objective — if they're spending 20 minutes searching, they're wrong.

**OPFOR:** REAPER supply element of 3-5 personnel with a lead scout. Play the scout 50-100 meters ahead. If the ambush is poorly set, have the scout detect it and the element withdraw. If it's well set, walk into the kill zone. After the ambush, have REAPER "react" by sending a patrol from the south 15-20 minutes later (this pressures the withdrawal timeline).

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation after return to COP. Brief refit before FRAGO 009.

---

**[FRAGO 009 — "SNARE"](009-frago-intercept-courier.html)** *(Intercept Courier, ~1300–1430)*
*Staff receives FRAGO during ambush execution (~1130). Staff briefs SLs at chow/rest.*

Documents recovered during the ambush (or simply "new intelligence") indicate a REAPER courier carrying orders from higher command is expected to transit through the Clearwater Avenue corridor (vicinity MP 0575 1538) within 2 hours. Capture the courier and recover the communications.

This is a FRAGO — shorter than a full OPORD but the staff must still develop squad taskings (intercept element, blocking/cordon, capture procedures). The staff receives the FRAGO while the ambush lane is executing, plans squad assignments, and briefs SLs during chow/rest. The 2-hour courier window creates real time pressure once the lane kicks off.

**Cadre focus:** Three evaluations. (1) Staff: planning from a FRAGO format — less information to work with, but the same requirement to produce squad taskings. Can they develop a coherent intercept plan from abbreviated information? (2) SL plan: intercept site selection, fire team positioning (who grabs the courier, who blocks escape routes, who provides security), security cordon placement, and actions on capture — does the SL have a plan for securing documents before the courier destroys them? (3) SL execution: speed of planning under time pressure — does the SL set up a proper intercept or just run out and hope? Handling of the detainee and document exploitation.

**OPFOR:** 1 courier + 1 escort, both armed with small arms. Traveling light and fast. If confronted, the escort delays while the courier escapes with documents. If capture is imminent, the courier attempts to destroy documents. Scale: if the SL's intercept is well-planned, the courier walks into it. If poorly planned, the escort spots them and the courier runs — allow a brief pursuit but don't let it spiral into a long chase.

*Expected duration: 1.5 hours (FRAGO — less planning time than a full OPORD)*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation. Cadre uses this time to set up the raid objective and brief OPFOR.

---

**[OPORD 004 — "IRON STRIKE"](004-raid.html)** *(Raid, ~1500–1700)*
*Staff receives order during intercept execution (~1330). Staff briefs SLs at chow/rest.*

Documents captured in the ambush reveal a REAPER weapons cache at MP 0611 1530 (east of the COP). The company commander orders a raid to destroy the cache. The OPORD is platoon-level only — the staff develops squad taskings (assault element, isolation/blocking, site exploitation plan) and briefs SLs. By this point the staff has done this three times (MTC, ambush, intercept) — they should be getting faster.

**Cadre focus:** Three evaluations. (1) Staff: by the fourth order, the staff should be producing squad taskings efficiently — look for improvement in speed and quality from earlier lanes. (2) SL plan: ORP selection, leader's recon, assault plan, time management on the objective (search THEN destroy — not the other way around), withdrawal route selection (different from approach). (3) Key evaluation points: Does the SL plan for REAPER reinforcement? Does the SL set a time limit on the objective?

**OPFOR:** 3-5 REAPER at the cache in a low-profile security posture. Scale resistance to the candidate — a strong SL gets a fight, a struggling SL gets a REAPER element that withdraws on contact. After the raid, regardless of outcome, REAPER consolidates north — this sets up OPORD 006.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

**Chow/Rest:** 30-minute chow rotation after return to COP. Brief candidates that REAPER is consolidating at the Jacksonville Street junction.

---

**[OPORD 006 — "FINAL ANVIL"](006-deliberate-attack.html)** *(Deliberate Attack — Capstone, ~1730–1900)*
*Staff receives mission statement during raid execution (~1530). Staff plans entire order independently.*

REAPER's remaining forces have consolidated at the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction (MP 0602 1565) — 150 meters north of the COP. The company commander orders 1st Platoon to seize the junction and finish REAPER in AO HERRERA. **This is the capstone.** The staff receives only a mission statement — no OPORD, no situation paragraph, no scheme of maneuver. They must plan the entire order independently: enemy analysis, scheme of maneuver, squad taskings, fires, sustainment, everything. Cadre holds the detailed OPORD as a safety net. **Last light is 1855 — this creates natural time pressure to complete the attack before dark.**

**Cadre focus:** This is the culminating evaluation for both the candidate staff AND the SLs. (1) Staff: can they produce a complete, coherent order from a mission statement alone? Did they do their own terrain analysis? Did they think about SBF positions, assault routes, blocking positions on Jacksonville St? This is the test of everything they've learned across the day. (2) SL plan: assault route selection (do NOT go straight up Bradenton Ave), fire team assignments for the assault, coordination with the supporting squad (shift/cease fire signals, timing), ORP and rally point selection, casualty collection point, and consolidation/reorganization plan on the objective. The proximity to the COP (150m) is a planning factor — the SL must still plan this properly, not just "run up the road."

**OPFOR:** 6-10 REAPER in hasty positions at the junction, oriented south. Low ammo, low morale. They fight but break when pressed. If the SL's plan is solid, REAPER collapses quickly. If the plan is poor (frontal assault up Bradenton), REAPER holds and inflicts casualties.

*Expected duration: 1.5-2 hours (complete before last light 1855)*

### Saturday Night — Transition to Rest

After the deliberate attack, consolidate back at COP Seggel. Chow (MRE), water resupply. Maintain COP security with a rest/security rotation. Brief candidates that AO HERRERA is effectively cleared but residual REAPER elements may attempt a spoiling attack overnight.

**Overnight inject options (keep light — candidates are exhausted):**
- Single REAPER probe testing the perimeter (evaluates alert status)
- Company FRAGO requesting an updated SITREP and ACE/LACE
- Simulated indirect fire (one round) to test stand-to procedures

**Priority is rest.** Saturday is the heaviest day of the FLX. Candidates need sleep before Sunday.

---

### Sunday Morning — ENDEX

**[OPORD 005 — "HOLD THE LINE"](005-cop-defense.html)** *(COP Defense — OPTIONAL)*
*Triggered at stand-to if cadre chooses to execute*

If cadre wants a final evaluation opportunity, trigger a REAPER counterattack on the COP at first light (0722 EDT — note time change). This is optional — execute only if there are candidates who still need an evaluated lane or if the defense looks like it needs testing.

**If executed:** REAPER attacks from the north along Bradenton Ave with a supporting attack from the west through the woodlines. Open with simulated indirect fire (2-3 minutes), then assault. Keep the attack to 15-20 minutes — this is a bookend, not a marathon.

**OPFOR:** Scale to available OPFOR and energy level. A short, sharp attack that tests the overnight defensive preparations. If positions are good, the defense succeeds quickly. If sloppy, REAPER penetrates and creates a decision point.

**If not executed:** Move directly to ENDEX procedures after morning stand-to.

---

**ENDEX and Recovery** *(~0800–1100 EDT)*

- ENDEX called after optional defense or at cadre's discretion
- Transition from tactical to administrative posture
- Police call of all training areas, COP, objective sites
- Weapons/equipment accountability and turn-in
- AAR — structured hot wash by lane, then overall FLX AAR
- Equipment turn-in to S4

## Evaluation Notes

**What the arc tests that individual STX lanes don't:**
- Planning from an established base (not a cold start at an AA)
- Departure from and return to a friendly position (link-up, recognition, fratricide prevention)
- Cumulative effects of decisions (poor COP setup makes the defense harder)
- Sustained operations under fatigue (Saturday morning MTC — candidates are tired from overnight, that's the point)
- Rapid planning from FRAGOs with incomplete information (007, 009)
- CP operations and battle tracking as a continuous activity, not a one-time setup
- Direct application of Thursday's preparation training (radios, ECP, CP ops, defensive planning)
- Time-pressure decision making (courier window, last-light deadlines)

**Thursday training → FLX connection:** Watch whether the SL who taught defensive planning actually applies it at the COP. Watch whether the candidate who taught ECP ops runs a sloppy ECP. The preparation training is their chance to study the material — the FLX is the test.

## Using the FLER in the FLX

The FLER is the feedback framework for the FLX — not a paperwork drill. TACs use the 8 TLP steps on the FLER to structure their observations and focus their after-lane feedback conversations. The goal is preparing candidates for the next phase of training by giving them specific, actionable feedback tied to the TLP process. We are not collecting FLERs as administrative products. TACs should have blank copies on hand as a reference and note-taking tool, but the priority is the face-to-face feedback, not the form.

### How the FLX Differs from a Standard STX Lane

**TLPs are spread across time.** Planning and execution are separated by hours, not minutes. TACs need to observe both phases to give meaningful feedback on the full TLP cycle. If you only watch the assault, you can only coach on execution — not the planning that drove it.

**Saturday SLs receive the mission from candidates, not cadre.** This creates coaching opportunities around TLP 1 (Receive the Mission) that don't exist in a normal lane. Did the SL ask clarifying questions when the staff brief was incomplete, or did they execute blind?

**Fatigue is cumulative and deliberate.** By Saturday afternoon, candidates are 30+ hours in. Where you see TLP breakdowns shifts — preparation steps (PCC/PCIs, rehearsals, contingency planning) degrade first. An SL who still conducts meaningful preparation on the capstone lane is demonstrating growth worth reinforcing.

**FRAGOs compress the cycle.** On FRAGO lanes (007, 009), some TLP steps merge or abbreviate. Focus feedback on whether the candidate made a *conscious decision* to abbreviate versus simply forgetting steps under pressure.

### PL and Candidate Staff Feedback

The PL on OPORD 001 maps directly to the FLER — the Thursday evening platoon OPORD to SLs is the primary TLP 7 moment. Use the same 8-step framework to structure feedback.

The **candidate staff** (CO, XO, Battle Captain) is developmental, not strictly evaluated. Use the FLER criteria and general leadership experience to provide feedback and refinement — focus on what they did well and what to work on, particularly around information flow, running estimates, battle tracking, and translating commander's guidance into a coherent brief. The staff positions are a growth opportunity; treat feedback accordingly.

### Feedback Guidance

**Be specific and tie feedback to TLP steps.** Reference observable moments: *"You used the terrain model to walk each TL through their position and confirmed fields of fire — that's strong TLP 7"* is more useful than *"Good order brief."* Likewise, *"Your squad departed for the raid with one radio not on platoon net — that's a TLP 4 gap in PCC/PCIs"* gives them something concrete to fix.

**Coaching vs. observation.** SFC Oppegard and the infantry instructors provide tactical coaching *after* the TAC has seen what they need to see. If a TAC redirects a dangerous plan mid-lane, note that in your feedback and coach on the candidate's response to the redirect, not the coached result.

**Build across lanes.** When a candidate leads multiple lanes, reference what you told them last time. Did they address the previous feedback? Reinforcing improvement (or calling out repeated gaps) across the FLX is more powerful than isolated lane-by-lane comments.
