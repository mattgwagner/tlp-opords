# FLX Cadre Brief — March 2026

**CADRE USE ONLY — DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES**

---

## Overview

This FLX is a 48-hour field exercise built around a single narrative: 1st Platoon moves to, occupies, and operates from Combat Outpost Seggel in AO HERRERA. Every mission flows from the one before it. Candidates rotate through squad leader roles across six lanes, each building on the evolving tactical situation.

Cadre issues each OPORD as a platoon-level order. The evaluated candidate (as SL) receives the order, conducts TLP, develops their scheme of maneuver and team-level tasks, briefs it, and executes. We do not prescribe how the candidate organizes their element — that's the evaluation.

## The Arc

### Day 1 — Establish and Orient

**OPORD 001 — "ESTABLISH COP SEGGEL"**
*Briefed at the RTI before SP*

The company commander issues the base order. 1st Platoon moves tactically from the RTI through two checkpoints (CP ANVIL and CP FORGE) to COP Seggel. They clear the facility, establish perimeter security and the ECP, stand up the company CP, and prepare defensive positions.

This is not a TLP lane — it's a briefed order that the candidates execute. Use the movement phase to evaluate basic competence: formations, movement techniques, security halts, danger area crossings. The clearing and occupation phase evaluates the SL's ability to transition from movement to offense to defense.

*Expected duration: 3-4 hours including movement*

---

**OPORD 002 — "MAP THE AO"** *(Area Reconnaissance)*
*Issued from COP Seggel once occupation is complete*

The cadre (as PL) needs to know what's around us. The evaluated SL receives the order and must plan a reconnaissance of two Named Areas of Interest: NAI 1 (Jacksonville Street corridor, MP 0602 1565) and NAI 2 (western woodlines / Clearwater Ave corridor, MP 0575 1538). The SL has to decide how to organize recon elements and COP security with the personnel available.

**Cadre focus:** Recon planning, stealth, reporting discipline, balancing recon effort with COP security. The SL who sends everyone out and leaves the COP exposed is wrong. The SL who keeps too many back and sends a token patrol is playing it too safe. Look for the balance.

**OPFOR:** REAPER observation posts in both NAIs. They observe and withdraw — do not engage the recon patrols. If a patrol is loud or sloppy, have REAPER shadow them and report. This feeds the narrative: REAPER now knows we're patrolling.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

---

### Day 1 Night — COP Operations

No formal lanes overnight. The candidates run the COP: security rotation, rest plan, CP operations, radio watch. This is where you evaluate candidates on sustainment, battle tracking, and managing the rest/security balance.

**Inject options:**
- REAPER probe of the perimeter (small element, breaks contact quickly)
- Noise or movement in the woodlines triggering a stand-to
- Civilian approaching the ECP at night
- FRAGO from company requesting a SITREP or LACE report
- Simulated indirect fire (one or two rounds) to test overhead cover and dispersion

None of these need to be full lanes. They're short-duration events that keep candidates engaged and create evaluation moments.

---

### Day 2 Morning

**OPORD 003 — "CUT THE LINE"** *(Ambush)*
*Issued at COP Seggel*

Recon from OPORD 002 identified a REAPER resupply route along Bradenton Avenue. Intel indicates regular supply runs moving north past MP 0600 1530. The company commander orders an ambush to cut the supply line and capture intelligence.

The SL must plan: ORP, ambush site, kill zone, assault/support/security, withdrawal route back to COP, and who stays behind to hold the COP. The critical planning challenge is the departure from and return to the COP — link-up procedures, recognition signals, and avoiding fratricide with the COP garrison.

**Cadre focus:** Ambush site selection, kill zone orientation, initiation criteria (what if civilians are in the kill zone?), speed on the objective, withdrawal discipline. Evaluate the SL's plan for time on objective — if they're spending 20 minutes searching, they're wrong.

**OPFOR:** REAPER supply element of 3-5 personnel with a lead scout. Play the scout 50-100 meters ahead. If the ambush is poorly set, have the scout detect it and the element withdraw. If it's well set, walk into the kill zone. After the ambush, have REAPER "react" by sending a patrol from the south 15-20 minutes later (this pressures the withdrawal timeline).

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

---

### Day 2 Afternoon

**OPORD 004 — "IRON STRIKE"** *(Raid)*
*Issued at COP Seggel*

Documents captured in the ambush reveal a REAPER weapons cache at MP 0611 1530 (east of the COP). The cadre (as PL) orders a raid to destroy the cache. This is the most complex offensive operation in the FLX — the SL must plan an ORP, leader's recon, assault, site exploitation (search and collect intel before destroying), and withdrawal, all while maintaining COP security.

**Cadre focus:** ORP selection, leader's recon plan, assault plan, time management on the objective (search THEN destroy — not the other way around), withdrawal route selection (different from approach), and COP security plan. The two key evaluation points: (1) Does the SL plan for the possibility that REAPER reinforced the cache after losing the supply element? (2) Does the SL set a time limit on the objective?

**OPFOR:** 3-5 REAPER at the cache in a low-profile security posture. Scale resistance to the candidate — a strong SL gets a fight, a struggling SL gets a REAPER element that withdraws on contact. After the raid, regardless of outcome, REAPER "decides to counterattack the COP" — this sets up OPORD 005.

*Expected duration: 2 hours*

---

### Day 2 Night — Transition to Defense

After the raid, brief candidates that intelligence indicates REAPER is consolidating for a counterattack. This creates urgency for the overnight defensive preparations. The SL receiving OPORD 005 should be identified and briefed before the overnight period so they can use the time to plan and improve positions.

**Overnight inject options:**
- REAPER recon probes testing the perimeter (evaluates alert status)
- Indirect fire simulation (evaluates overhead cover, dispersion, and CP continuity)
- Company FRAGO requesting an updated defensive plan with sector sketches

---

### Day 3 Morning

**OPORD 005 — "HOLD THE LINE"** *(COP Defense)*
*Issued at COP Seggel — can be triggered at stand-to*

REAPER has consolidated and is counterattacking COP Seggel. The attack comes from the north (Bradenton Ave corridor / Jacksonville St junction) and west (woodlines). The SL must have defensive positions prepared, sectors of fire assigned, OP/LPs out, engagement areas planned, indirect fire targets registered, and a QRF designated.

**Cadre focus:** Sector sketches, interlocking fields of fire, engagement area development, OP/LP positioning, QRF employment, indirect fire planning, and CP continuity under fire. The defense should feel like a test of everything they've built over the past 36 hours — if positions are good, the defense succeeds. If positions are sloppy, REAPER penetrates.

**OPFOR:** Main attack from the north along Bradenton Ave, supporting attack from the west through the woodlines. Open with simulated indirect fire (2-3 minutes), then assault. Scale intensity to the defense — if positions are strong, press harder to create decision points. If positions are weak, penetrate and force the SL to commit the QRF. The attack should last 20-30 minutes.

*Expected duration: 2 hours (including preparation time)*

---

### Day 3 Late Morning (If Time Permits)

**OPORD 006 — "FINAL ANVIL"** *(Deliberate Attack)*
*Issued at COP Seggel after repelling the counterattack*

REAPER's counterattack failed. Their surviving forces have withdrawn to the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction (MP 0602 1565) — 150 meters north of the COP. Cadre (as PL) orders the element to seize the junction and finish REAPER in AO HERRERA. This is the capstone: a short-range deliberate attack from an established base against a known, degraded enemy position.

**Cadre focus:** SBF position selection, assault route (do NOT go straight up Bradenton Ave), security/blocking positions on Jacksonville St to prevent escape, consolidation on the objective. The proximity to the COP (150m) is a planning factor — the SL must still plan this properly, not just "run up the road."

**OPFOR:** 6-10 REAPER in hasty positions at the junction, oriented south. Low ammo, low morale. They fight but break when pressed. If the SL's plan is solid, REAPER collapses quickly. If the plan is poor (frontal assault up Bradenton), REAPER holds and inflicts casualties.

*Expected duration: 1.5-2 hours*

## Evaluation Notes

**What the arc tests that individual STX lanes don't:**
- Planning from an established base (not a cold start at an AA)
- Departure from and return to a friendly position (link-up, recognition, fratricide prevention)
- Cumulative effects of decisions (poor COP setup makes the defense harder)
- Sustained operations under fatigue (Day 3 candidates are tired — that's the point)
- CP operations and battle tracking as a continuous activity, not a one-time setup

**Common candidate failures to watch for:**
- Leaving the COP undefended while conducting offensive operations
- No plan for link-up / re-entry to the COP after patrols
- No time limit on the objective during the raid
- Defensive positions with no overhead cover or gaps in sectors of fire
- Failing to coordinate with adjacent elements or report to higher (cadre as PL)
- No rest plan — running everyone into the ground by Day 2
