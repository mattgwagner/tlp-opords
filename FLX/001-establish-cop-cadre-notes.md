# CADRE NOTES — FLX Base Order: Establish COP Seggel

**FOR CADRE USE ONLY — DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES**

---

## Purpose

This is the base order for the Leadership Field Exercise (LFX). It provides the tactical situation, enemy picture, and operational framework for the entire exercise. Candidates are briefed on this OPORD at the RTI before stepping off. All subsequent missions (patrols, raids, reconnaissance, defense) will be issued as FRAGOs from COP Seggel.

## Sequence of Events

1. Candidates receive OPORD briefing at the RTI.
2. Platoon conducts tactical movement from the RTI through CP ANVIL (MP 0589 1455), CP FORGE (MP 0566 1465), and CP HAMMER (MP 0575 1524).
3. Platoon establishes a security halt and the PL conducts a leader's recon of COP Seggel.
4. Platoon clears, occupies, and secures the COP.
5. PSG establishes the company CP with battle tracking and comms.
6. Platoon prepares defensive positions and stages for follow-on operations issued as FRAGOs.

## Movement Intent

The three checkpoints between RTI and COP Seggel serve a dual purpose — they route the platoon along a reasonable path that adds distance to build tactical discipline during movement and they create evaluation opportunities for the PL's movement planning, formations, security halts, and danger area crossings before the platoon reaches the COP. Use them to assess baseline competence before the more complex clearing and occupation phases.

## Training Focus

- Movement planning and execution
- Tactical formations and movement techniques
- Security during movement and danger area crossings
- Multi-phase operations (movement → offense → defense transition)
- Building clearing under uncertainty
- CP establishment and operations
- Battle tracking
- Communications management (dual-net)
- Sustainment planning for extended operations
- Defensive planning

## OPFOR / Training Wrinkles

- Inject a REAPER reconnaissance element observing the movement between CP FORGE and CP HAMMER to test security and reporting.
- Vary REAPER presence at COP Seggel: empty facility, observation element only, or occupied and defended.
- Simulate indirect fire (mortar) attack after occupation to test overhead cover and dispersion planning.
- Introduce host nation materials left behind (booby traps, usable supplies, intelligence value items).
- Use civilian role-players approaching the COP to test ROE and entrance control procedures.
- Issue follow-on FRAGOs from the COP to test CP operations and battle tracking under pressure.
- Inject casualty scenarios during movement or clearing to test MEDEVAC coordination.
- Simulate REAPER counterattack probe to test defensive posture and QRF employment.

**NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## Iteration Guidance

This OPORD is briefed to candidates — it is NOT a TLP planning exercise. Candidates receive the order, ask clarifying questions, and execute. Evaluation begins during movement (Phase 1) and continues through occupation (Phase 4). Follow-on TLP evaluation lanes are issued as FRAGOs from the COP once established.
