## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. 1st Platoon occupies COP Seggel (MP 0610 1550). Overnight security observed REAPER movement in the woodlines north and northwest of COP Seggel. OP/LPs reported foot traffic, low-light signals, and radio transmissions consistent with a REAPER element repositioning. At least one REAPER probe was detected and repelled during the night. REAPER is massing or repositioning in the woodlines between COP Seggel and Jacksonville Street, likely in preparation for further offensive action.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The area north and northwest of COP Seggel consists of dense pine and hardwood forests with visibility under 50 meters. The woodlines between COP Seggel and Jacksonville Street (approximately 150 meters) provide concealment for both friendly and enemy forces. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center, offering a cleared corridor but also an exposed avenue of approach. The woodlines west of Bradenton Avenue between the COP and Clearwater Avenue (MP 0575 area) are dense and provide covered movement routes.

   - **Key Terrain:** The woodline edge north of COP Seggel (approximately 75-100 meters from the perimeter) is the likely REAPER staging area. Jacksonville Street (MP 0602 1565) remains the likely REAPER fallback position. The woodlines west of Bradenton Avenue provide a flanking approach.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 07 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: Low 63°F at BMNT, rising to 78°F
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0623
   - Sunrise: 0648
   - Sunset: 1831
   - EENT: 1855

Candidates will be operating under fatigue from overnight security operations.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER has been repositioning overnight. The element detected by OP/LPs is estimated at squad size and appears to be staging for either continued reconnaissance of COP Seggel or preparation for an attack. REAPER's exact location and disposition are unknown — that is the purpose of this operation.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 6-8 REAPER personnel with small arms and communications equipment. Possible crew-served weapon.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER is in the woodlines north/northwest of COP Seggel, between the COP perimeter and Jacksonville Street. Exact positions unknown.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER is staged in a hasty assembly area in the woodlines, preparing to conduct further reconnaissance or probing attacks. Upon detecting the friendly advance, REAPER breaks contact and withdraws north toward Jacksonville Street.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has established a hasty ambush along a likely patrol route north of COP Seggel, anticipating a friendly response to the overnight activity. They initiate the ambush to inflict casualties and then withdraw.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company locates and engages REAPER forces operating in the vicinity of COP Seggel to prevent further enemy reconnaissance and disrupt attack preparations.

**3. Adjacent Units.** Company HQ maintains CP operations at COP Seggel. COP security is notional during this operation.

### e. Civil Considerations
Unlikely at this hour. Report any civilian presence immediately.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.
