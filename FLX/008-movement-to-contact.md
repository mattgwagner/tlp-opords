## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. 1st Platoon occupies COP Seggel (MP 0610 1550). Overnight security observed REAPER movement in the woodlines north and northwest of COP Seggel. OP/LPs reported foot traffic, low-light signals, and radio transmissions consistent with a REAPER element repositioning. At least one REAPER probe was detected and repelled during the night. REAPER is massing or repositioning in the woodlines between COP Seggel and Jacksonville Street, likely in preparation for further offensive action.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The area north and northwest of COP Seggel consists of dense pine and hardwood forests with visibility under 50 meters. The woodlines between COP Seggel and Jacksonville Street (approximately 150 meters) provide concealment for both friendly and enemy forces. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center, offering a cleared corridor but also an exposed avenue of approach. The woodlines west of Bradenton Avenue between the COP and Clearwater Avenue (MP 0575 area) are dense and provide covered movement routes.

   - **Key Terrain:** The woodline edge north of COP Seggel (approximately 75-100 meters from the perimeter) is the likely REAPER staging area. Jacksonville Street (MP 0602 1565) remains the likely REAPER fallback position. The woodlines west of Bradenton Avenue provide a flanking approach.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 07 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: Low 63°F at BMNT, rising to 78°F
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - First light: 0623
   - Sunrise: 0648
   - Sunset: 1831
   - Last light: 1855

Reduced visibility at first light. Candidates will be operating under fatigue from overnight security operations.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER has been repositioning overnight. The element detected by OP/LPs is estimated at squad size and appears to be staging for either continued reconnaissance of COP Seggel or preparation for an attack. REAPER's exact location and disposition are unknown — that is the purpose of this operation.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 6-8 REAPER personnel with small arms and communications equipment. Possible crew-served weapon.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER is in the woodlines north/northwest of COP Seggel, between the COP perimeter and Jacksonville Street. Exact positions unknown.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER is staged in a hasty assembly area in the woodlines, preparing to conduct further reconnaissance or probing attacks. Upon detecting the friendly advance, REAPER breaks contact and withdraws north toward Jacksonville Street.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has established a hasty ambush along a likely patrol route north of COP Seggel, anticipating a friendly response to the overnight activity. They initiate the ambush to inflict casualties and then withdraw.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company locates and engages REAPER forces operating in the vicinity of COP Seggel to prevent further enemy reconnaissance and disrupt attack preparations.

**3. Adjacent Units.** COP Seggel remains manned and defended. Elements not conducting the MTC maintain security at the COP.

### e. Civil Considerations
Unlikely at this hour. Report any civilian presence immediately.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

A Company locates and engages REAPER forces operating in the woodlines north of COP Seggel NLT 0630 on 07 MAR 26 in order to disrupt enemy preparations and maintain security of the COP. 1st Platoon conducts the movement to contact.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Disrupt REAPER preparations in the woodlines north of COP Seggel and prevent further enemy reconnaissance of friendly positions.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Advance from COP Seggel into the woodlines north of the perimeter at first light. (2) Locate and engage the REAPER element. (3) Develop the situation — determine REAPER strength, disposition, and intent. (4) Maintain contact and report. Do not pursue beyond Jacksonville Street without orders.

**End State:** REAPER element located and engaged, enemy driven from the immediate vicinity of COP Seggel, platoon consolidated and returned to COP or holding a forward position as directed.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a movement to contact from COP Seggel north into the woodlines at first light. The platoon advances using bounding overwatch, develops the situation upon contact, and engages the REAPER element. The platoon must maintain security of COP Seggel with elements not conducting the MTC. Do not pursue beyond Jacksonville Street. Upon breaking contact or driving REAPER from the area, consolidate and return to COP Seggel. Indirect fire support available through company on request.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon has priority of indirect fires. Priority of fires to the element in contact. Indirect fire support available through company on request.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Platoon (Main Effort — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Depart COP Seggel and advance north into the woodlines at first light. Move using bounding overwatch. Locate and engage the REAPER element detected during overnight operations. Develop the situation — assess enemy strength and disposition before committing to decisive engagement. Do not advance beyond Jacksonville Street (MP 0602 1565) without further orders. Report all contact. Consolidate and return to COP Seggel upon completion.
- **PURPOSE:** Disrupt REAPER operations in the vicinity of COP Seggel and prevent enemy forces from staging for an attack against the COP.

**1a. 1st Squad (Advance Element — Main Effort):**

- **TASK:** Lead the advance north from COP Seggel along the Bradenton Avenue axis into the woodlines. Move using bounding overwatch. Develop the situation upon contact — report enemy strength and disposition before committing to decisive engagement. If enemy contact is made, fix the enemy and report to allow 2nd Squad to maneuver. Do not advance beyond Jacksonville Street without orders.
- **PURPOSE:** Locate and fix the REAPER element to enable the platoon to develop the situation and destroy the enemy force.

**1b. 2nd Squad (Supporting Effort — Eastern Screen):**

- **TASK:** Depart COP Seggel and advance north along a parallel route east of Bradenton Avenue through the woodlines. Screen the eastern flank of 1st Squad's advance. Prevent REAPER elements from flanking or encircling the advance element. Upon 1st Squad contact, maneuver to support — either envelop the enemy position or establish a blocking position to prevent enemy withdrawal east. Report all sightings and maintain communication with 1st Squad.
- **PURPOSE:** Protect 1st Squad's flank during the advance and provide the platoon a maneuver element to exploit contact.

**1c. Company HQ:**

- **TASK:** Maintain CP operations at COP Seggel. Track both squad movements on the battle board. Process SALUTE and SITREP reports. Coordinate indirect fire requests. Remaining company garrison elements maintain COP security (notional).
