# Candidate Company Staff Guide — FLX Saturday Execution

**FOR CADRE USE ONLY**

## Purpose

On Saturday of the FLX, top-performing candidates are elevated to company-level staff roles. They take over the planning and order-issuance function, briefing directly to squad leaders. This creates a realistic order flow, gives top performers a stretch assignment, and keeps the chain short: **Cadre → Candidate Staff → SLs**.

## Saturday Reorganization

### Force Structure Change (3 Squads → 2 Squads + Company HQ)

Friday's 3-squad organization becomes:

| Element | Strength | Composition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Company HQ** | 3 candidates | CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO |
| **1st Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |
| **2nd Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |

**Total: 25 candidates**

The overstrength squads (11 vs. standard 9) give each SL solid maneuver elements with two full fire teams.

### COP Security During Maneuver

**Both squads leave the wire every lane.** One squad executes the main effort, the other executes a supporting effort (blocking position, isolation, screening, security). Company HQ maintains CP operations from the COP.

COP security during maneuver is **notional** — the OPORD states "remaining company garrison elements maintain COP security." Do not tie real candidates to static COP defense on Saturday.

## Selecting Candidates for Company Staff

### When to Select
Friday evening, after FRAGO 007. Cadre has observed candidates for ~18 hours (Thursday planning + Friday execution) and should have a clear picture of top performers. Selecting Friday evening gives the candidate staff time to receive OPORD 008 and prepare their brief overnight.

### Selection Criteria
Look for candidates who have demonstrated:
- **Strong TLP execution** — produced a coherent plan when given an OPORD (Thursday/Friday)
- **Clear communication** — issued orders that subordinates could understand and act on
- **Situational awareness** — tracked the tactical picture and adapted to changing conditions
- **Initiative** — didn't wait to be told; identified problems and acted
- **Peer leadership** — others naturally look to them for guidance

### Who NOT to Select
- Candidates who still need SL evaluation lanes (haven't had enough opportunities yet)
- Candidates you want to see under pressure at the SL level one more time
- Candidates who are strong executors but haven't demonstrated planning ability

### How to Announce
Brief the selected candidates privately. Frame it as: "You've demonstrated strong performance. We're putting you in a company staff role for the rest of the FLX. You'll be planning and issuing orders to the squad leaders. This is a leadership evaluation — we're watching how you plan at a higher level and how clearly you can issue orders."

## Role Definitions

### Candidate Company Commander (CO / Briefer)
- **Primary role:** Receives the mission from cadre, develops the plan, and briefs the order directly to SLs
- Acts as the pseudo-platoon leader — the person SLs receive their orders from
- Makes tactical decisions during execution (within the scope cadre allows)
- Evaluated on: planning quality, order clarity, decision-making

### Candidate XO
- **Primary role:** Sustainment planning, logistics coordination, battle tracking at the company CP
- Maintains running estimates (personnel, ammo, water, time)
- Tracks the operation from the CP and keeps the CO informed
- Manages the rest/security rotation plan
- Evaluated on: staff work, tracking, logistics foresight

### Candidate Battle Captain / RTO
- **Primary role:** Communications management — monitors company and platoon nets
- Processes incoming reports (SALUTE, SITREP, LACE) and posts to the battle tracking board
- Relays information between the CO and SLs during execution
- Manages the message log
- Evaluated on: radio discipline, information processing, communication clarity

## Staff vs. SL Planning Boundary

**The staff says WHAT each squad does. The SL plans HOW.**

The staff brief to SLs includes:
- Task and purpose for each squad (main effort / supporting effort)
- Coordination between squads (boundaries, phase lines, signals)
- Timeline and reporting requirements

The staff brief does **NOT** include:
- Fire team assignments or task organization within the squad
- Movement routes or techniques
- Actions on the objective below the squad level
- ORP/rally point selection

Those are the SL's planning decisions — that's where the SL evaluation lives. If the candidate CO starts briefing fire team assignments or dictating how the squad moves, cadre redirects: *"CO, that's the SL's plan. Give them their task and purpose and let them figure out how."*

## Progressive Scaffolding — Staff Independence Increases Across the Day

| Lane | What staff receives | What staff develops | Cadre coaching |
|------|----|----|-----|
| 008 MTC | Platoon-level OPORD (Friday evening) | Squad taskings overnight | Coach first brief if needed |
| 003 Ambush | Platoon-level OPORD (during MTC) | Squad taskings during the lane | Light coaching — they've done this once |
| 009 Intercept | FRAGO (during ambush) | Squad taskings from abbreviated info | Observe — less information to work with |
| 004 Raid | Platoon-level OPORD (during intercept) | Squad taskings — should be efficient by now | Observe — evaluate improvement |
| 006 Deliberate Attack | **Mission statement only** (during raid) | **Entire order from scratch** | **Do not coach — evaluate** |

### Lanes 1–4: Platoon-Level Orders (008, 003, 009, 004)

**How it works:**
1. Cadre provides the candidate staff with a **platoon-level OPORD** (or FRAGO) — the order includes the platoon task and purpose, concept of operations, and coordinating instructions, but does **not** assign squad-level tasks
2. The candidate staff develops squad taskings: which squad is main effort, which is supporting effort, what each squad's task and purpose is, and coordination between them
3. The candidate CO **briefs the order directly to SLs** including their squad assignments
4. SLs receive their squad task, conduct their own TLPs (route, fire team tasks, actions on OBJ, sand table), and execute

**Cadre role:**
- For the first lane (008), coach the staff through the briefing format if needed — this is their first time
- For subsequent lanes (003, 009, 004), reduce coaching progressively — observe whether the staff is getting faster and producing better squad taskings
- Have the cadre detailed version ready as a safety net for every lane
- Watch how the CO handles SL questions during the brief — a good CO can explain their reasoning, a weak CO freezes

**What "developing squad taskings" looks like:**
- Deciding which squad is main effort vs. supporting effort for this lane
- Writing a task and purpose for each squad based on the concept of operations
- Determining coordination between squads (where they link up, how they communicate, phase lines)
- Adjusting timeline and reporting requirements

### Lane 5: Mission Statement Only (006 — Capstone)

**How it works:**
1. Cadre issues a **mission statement only** (1-2 paragraphs) to the candidate staff — no OPORD, no situation, no scheme of maneuver
2. Candidate staff develops the full order: enemy analysis, scheme of maneuver, squad taskings, fires, sustainment, command and signal
3. The candidate CO briefs the order directly to SLs
4. SLs conduct their own TLPs and execute

**Mission statement format (what cadre gives):**
> "REAPER's remaining forces have consolidated at the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction (MP 0602 1565). Estimated squad-sized element with small arms in hasty fighting positions. A Company seizes OBJ HERRERA NLT [time] in order to destroy remaining REAPER forces and complete the clearing of AO HERRERA. 1st Platoon is the main effort. Last light is 1855."

That's it. The candidate staff must develop the full order from this.

**Cadre role:**
- Do not coach the planning process — observe and evaluate
- Intervene only if the order is so poor that SLs cannot plan against it (safety net)
- If you must redirect, do it through the candidate CO, not directly to SLs: "CO, your order doesn't address how 2nd Squad supports the assault. What's their task?"
- Evaluate: Did the staff produce a coherent order? Could SLs plan from it? Did the CO handle questions?

## Safety Net Procedures

### When to Intervene
- The candidate CO's order is missing critical information that SLs need to plan (no scheme of maneuver, no squad tasks, no timeline)
- SLs are visibly confused and cannot begin TLPs after 15 minutes
- The tactical plan is genuinely dangerous (not just suboptimal — actually unsafe)

### How to Intervene
1. **First**: Coach through the candidate CO. "CO, your SLs don't know where 2nd Squad is supposed to be. What's their task?"
2. **Second**: If the CO can't recover, provide the candidate staff with specific guidance from the cadre detailed version
3. **Last resort**: Cadre issues the pre-scripted order directly. This counts as a significant evaluation event for the candidate CO.

### What Is NOT an Intervention
- The plan is different from what cadre would have done — that's fine, it's their plan
- The plan has minor gaps that SLs can work around — let the SLs adapt
- Execution doesn't go as planned — that's a learning moment, not a failure

## Evaluation Notes

### What to Watch For — Company Staff
| Candidate | Strong Performance | Weak Performance |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **CO** | Coherent plan, clear brief, handles SL questions, makes decisions during execution | Rambling brief, SLs confused, freezes when asked questions, won't make decisions |
| **XO** | Maintains running estimates, anticipates logistics issues, tracks the operation | Loses track of personnel status, no logistics awareness, passive in CP |
| **BC/RTO** | Processes reports promptly, maintains comms discipline, keeps board updated | Misses reports, loses comms with elements, board is blank or wrong |

### Connecting to the FLER
These are leadership evaluation opportunities. Document them the same way you would a TLP lane:
- **Did the candidate plan?** (Staff work, order development)
- **Did the candidate communicate?** (Order brief, radio management, information flow)
- **Did the candidate lead?** (Decisions during execution, adaptation, presence)
