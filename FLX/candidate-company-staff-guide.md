# Candidate Company Staff Guide — FLX Saturday Execution

## Your Role

On Saturday of the FLX, you have been selected for a company-level staff role. You will take over the planning and order-issuance function, briefing directly to squad leaders. The order flow is: **Cadre → You → SLs**.

This is a leadership evaluation. You are being assessed on how you plan at a higher level, how clearly you issue orders, and how you manage operations from the CP.

## Saturday Force Structure

Friday's 3-squad organization becomes:

| Element | Strength | Composition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Company HQ** | 3 candidates | CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO |
| **1st Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |
| **2nd Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |

**Total: 25 candidates**

**Both squads leave the wire every lane.** One squad executes the main effort, the other executes a supporting effort (blocking position, isolation, screening, security). Company HQ maintains CP operations from the COP.

COP security during maneuver is **notional** — the OPORD states "remaining company garrison elements maintain COP security."

## Role Definitions

### Company Commander (CO / Briefer)
- **Primary role:** Receives the mission from cadre, develops the plan, and briefs the order directly to SLs
- Acts as the pseudo-platoon leader — the person SLs receive their orders from
- Makes tactical decisions during execution (within the scope cadre allows)

### Executive Officer (XO)
- **Primary role:** Sustainment planning, logistics coordination, battle tracking at the company CP
- Maintains running estimates (personnel, ammo, water, time)
- Tracks the operation from the CP and keeps the CO informed
- Manages the rest/security rotation plan

### Battle Captain / RTO
- **Primary role:** Communications management — monitors company and platoon nets
- Processes incoming reports (SALUTE, SITREP, LACE) and posts to the battle tracking board
- Relays information between the CO and SLs during execution
- Manages the message log

## What You Brief to SLs vs. What They Plan

**You provide:** Task and purpose for each squad (main effort / supporting effort), coordination between squads (boundaries, phase lines, signals), timeline and reporting requirements.

**You do NOT dictate:** Fire team assignments or task organization within the squad, movement routes or techniques, actions on the objective below the squad level, or ORP/rally point selection. Those are the SL's planning decisions.

Give the SLs their task and purpose, then let them figure out how to execute it.

## How Saturday Works — Progressive Responsibility

Your responsibility increases across the day:

| Lane | What you receive | What you develop |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| 008 MTC | Platoon-level OPORD (Friday evening) | Squad taskings — develop overnight, brief SLs at stand-down |
| 003 Ambush | Platoon-level OPORD | Squad taskings — develop during previous lane, brief at chow/rest |
| 009 Intercept | FRAGO (abbreviated) | Squad taskings from less information |
| 004 Raid | Platoon-level OPORD | Squad taskings — you should be getting faster by now |
| 006 Deliberate Attack | **Mission statement only** | **Plan the entire order independently** |

### Lanes 1–4: Platoon-Level Orders (008, 003, 009, 004)

1. Cadre provides you with a **platoon-level OPORD** (or FRAGO) — it includes the platoon task and purpose, concept of operations, and coordinating instructions, but does **not** assign squad-level tasks
2. You develop squad taskings: which squad is main effort, which is supporting effort, what each squad's task and purpose is, and coordination between them
3. The CO **briefs the order directly to SLs** including squad assignments
4. SLs receive their squad task, conduct their own TLPs, and execute

**Developing squad taskings means:**
- Deciding which squad is main effort vs. supporting effort for this lane
- Writing a task and purpose for each squad based on the concept of operations
- Determining coordination between squads (where they link up, how they communicate, phase lines)
- Adjusting timeline and reporting requirements

### Lane 5: Mission Statement Only (006 — Capstone)

1. Cadre gives you a **mission statement only** (1-2 paragraphs) — no OPORD, no situation, no scheme of maneuver
2. You develop the full order: enemy analysis, scheme of maneuver, squad taskings, fires, sustainment, command and signal
3. The CO briefs the order directly to SLs
4. SLs conduct their own TLPs and execute

**Example of what you'll receive:**
> "REAPER's remaining forces have consolidated at the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction (MP 0602 1565). Estimated squad-sized element with small arms in hasty fighting positions. A Company seizes OBJ HERRERA NLT [time] in order to destroy remaining REAPER forces and complete the clearing of AO HERRERA. 1st Platoon is the main effort. Last light is 1855."

That's it. You must develop the full order from this.
