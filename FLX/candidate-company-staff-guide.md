# Candidate Company Staff Guide — FLX Saturday Execution

**FOR CADRE USE ONLY**

## Purpose

On Saturday of the FLX, top-performing candidates are elevated to company-level staff roles. They take over the planning and order-issuance function, briefing directly to squad leaders. This creates a realistic order flow, gives top performers a stretch assignment, and keeps the chain short: **Cadre → Candidate Staff → SLs**.

## Saturday Reorganization

### Force Structure Change (3 Squads → 2 Squads + Company HQ)

Friday's 3-squad organization becomes:

| Element | Strength | Composition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Company HQ** | 3 candidates | CO, XO, Battle Captain/RTO |
| **1st Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |
| **2nd Squad** | 11 candidates | SL + 2 fire teams (TL + 4 each) |

**Total: 25 candidates**

The overstrength squads (11 vs. standard 9) give each SL solid maneuver elements with two full fire teams.

### COP Security During Maneuver

**Both squads leave the wire every lane.** One squad executes the main effort, the other executes a supporting effort (blocking position, isolation, screening, security). Company HQ maintains CP operations from the COP.

COP security during maneuver is **notional** — the OPORD states "remaining company garrison elements maintain COP security." Do not tie real candidates to static COP defense on Saturday.

## Selecting Candidates for Company Staff

### When to Select
Saturday morning, before the first Saturday OPORD is issued. Cadre has observed candidates for ~18 hours (Thursday planning + Friday execution) and should have a clear picture of top performers.

### Selection Criteria
Look for candidates who have demonstrated:
- **Strong TLP execution** — produced a coherent plan when given an OPORD (Thursday/Friday)
- **Clear communication** — issued orders that subordinates could understand and act on
- **Situational awareness** — tracked the tactical picture and adapted to changing conditions
- **Initiative** — didn't wait to be told; identified problems and acted
- **Peer leadership** — others naturally look to them for guidance

### Who NOT to Select
- Candidates who still need SL evaluation lanes (haven't had enough opportunities yet)
- Candidates you want to see under pressure at the SL level one more time
- Candidates who are strong executors but haven't demonstrated planning ability

### How to Announce
Brief the selected candidates privately. Frame it as: "You've demonstrated strong performance. We're putting you in a company staff role for the rest of the FLX. You'll be planning and issuing orders to the squad leaders. This is a leadership evaluation — we're watching how you plan at a higher level and how clearly you can issue orders."

## Role Definitions

### Candidate Company Commander (CO / Briefer)
- **Primary role:** Receives the mission from cadre, develops the plan, and briefs the order directly to SLs
- Acts as the pseudo-platoon leader — the person SLs receive their orders from
- Makes tactical decisions during execution (within the scope cadre allows)
- Evaluated on: planning quality, order clarity, decision-making

### Candidate XO
- **Primary role:** Sustainment planning, logistics coordination, battle tracking at the company CP
- Maintains running estimates (personnel, ammo, water, time)
- Tracks the operation from the CP and keeps the CO informed
- Manages the rest/security rotation plan
- Evaluated on: staff work, tracking, logistics foresight

### Candidate Battle Captain / RTO
- **Primary role:** Communications management — monitors company and platoon nets
- Processes incoming reports (SALUTE, SITREP, LACE) and posts to the battle tracking board
- Relays information between the CO and SLs during execution
- Manages the message log
- Evaluated on: radio discipline, information processing, communication clarity

## Saturday Morning — Easing In (OPORDs 008, 003, 009)

### How It Works
1. Cadre provides the candidate staff with a **near-complete order** (the existing OPORD with task org updated for 2 squads)
2. Candidate staff reviews the order, makes minor refinements (adjusting timelines, confirming grid references, adding detail they think is missing)
3. The candidate CO **briefs the order directly to SLs** as if it were their own plan
4. SLs receive the order, conduct their own TLPs, and execute

### Cadre Role
- Coach the candidate staff through the first iteration if needed
- Let them struggle with the briefing format — this is a learning opportunity
- Observe how the CO handles SL questions during the brief
- Have the detailed cadre version ready as a safety net

### What "Minor Refinements" Looks Like
- Adjusting the timeline to match actual conditions (weather, light data, current disposition)
- Adding or clarifying squad-specific tasks based on the concept of operations
- Choosing which squad is main effort vs. supporting effort for this lane
- Adding detail to coordinating instructions based on lessons learned from Friday

## Saturday Afternoon — Independent Planning (OPORDs 004, 006)

### How It Works
1. Cadre issues a **mission statement only** (1-2 paragraphs) to the candidate staff — not a full OPORD
2. Candidate staff develops the full platoon order: situation, mission, execution with squad tasks, sustainment, command and signal
3. The candidate CO briefs the order directly to SLs
4. SLs conduct their own TLPs and execute

### Mission Statement Format (What Cadre Gives)
Example for OPORD 004 (Raid):
> "Intelligence from the reconnaissance and ambush operations indicates REAPER has a weapons cache at vicinity MP 0580 1538. A Company directs 1st Platoon to conduct a raid to seize and destroy the cache. The cache must be searched for intelligence value items before destruction. REAPER may have re-garrisoned the area after the loss of their supply element. Time available: 2 hours from receipt of this order."

That's it. The candidate staff must develop the full order from this.

### Cadre Role
- Do not coach the planning process — observe and evaluate
- Intervene only if the order is so poor that SLs cannot plan against it (safety net)
- If you must redirect, do it through the candidate CO, not directly to SLs: "CO, your order doesn't address how 2nd Squad supports the assault. What's their task?"
- Evaluate: Did the staff produce a coherent order? Could SLs plan from it? Did the CO handle questions?

## Safety Net Procedures

### When to Intervene
- The candidate CO's order is missing critical information that SLs need to plan (no scheme of maneuver, no squad tasks, no timeline)
- SLs are visibly confused and cannot begin TLPs after 15 minutes
- The tactical plan is genuinely dangerous (not just suboptimal — actually unsafe)

### How to Intervene
1. **First**: Coach through the candidate CO. "CO, your SLs don't know where 2nd Squad is supposed to be. What's their task?"
2. **Second**: If the CO can't recover, provide the candidate staff with specific guidance from the cadre detailed version
3. **Last resort**: Cadre issues the pre-scripted order directly. This counts as a significant evaluation event for the candidate CO.

### What Is NOT an Intervention
- The plan is different from what cadre would have done — that's fine, it's their plan
- The plan has minor gaps that SLs can work around — let the SLs adapt
- Execution doesn't go as planned — that's a learning moment, not a failure

## Evaluation Notes

### What to Watch For — Company Staff
| Candidate | Strong Performance | Weak Performance |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **CO** | Coherent plan, clear brief, handles SL questions, makes decisions during execution | Rambling brief, SLs confused, freezes when asked questions, won't make decisions |
| **XO** | Maintains running estimates, anticipates logistics issues, tracks the operation | Loses track of personnel status, no logistics awareness, passive in CP |
| **BC/RTO** | Processes reports promptly, maintains comms discipline, keeps board updated | Misses reports, loses comms with elements, board is blank or wrong |

### Connecting to the FLER
These are leadership evaluation opportunities. Document them the same way you would a TLP lane:
- **Did the candidate plan?** (Staff work, order development)
- **Did the candidate communicate?** (Order brief, radio management, information flow)
- **Did the candidate lead?** (Decisions during execution, adaptation, presence)
