## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. 1st Platoon occupies COP Seggel (MP 0610 1550). Over the past 36 hours, 1st Platoon has conducted aggressive operations from the COP — reconnaissance patrols mapped REAPER positions, an ambush destroyed a REAPER resupply element, and a raid eliminated a key weapons cache. REAPER leadership has consolidated remaining forces and is preparing to counterattack COP Seggel to push friendly forces out of AO HERRERA. Intelligence indicates REAPER will attack within the next 6-12 hours, most likely from the north along the Jacksonville Street corridor and from the woodlines west of the COP.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** COP Seggel is a facility complex at MP 0610 1550 with multiple buildings and hardened structures. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south along the east side of the COP. Jacksonville Street runs east-west approximately 150 meters north, intersecting Bradenton Avenue at MP 0602 1565. Dense woodlines surround the facility on all sides, restricting observation to under 50 meters except along the road corridors. The Bradenton Avenue corridor provides fields of fire to the north and south. The woodlines to the west and north provide concealed approaches for attacking forces. Buildings within the COP provide overhead cover and hardened defensive positions.

   - **Key Terrain:** The intersection of Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565) is the most likely staging area for the REAPER assault. The woodlines north of the COP (between COP and Jacksonville St) provide the final covered and concealed approach for an attacking force. The woodlines west of the COP provide a secondary approach axis. Buildings with overhead cover within the COP are critical for the CP and for protection against indirect fire. Entrance points along Bradenton Avenue must be controlled to canalize attacking forces.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 07 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: High 78°F / Low 63°F (heat cat 1 — green)
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0555
   - Sunrise: 0647
   - Sunset: 1831
   - EENT: 1923

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER has consolidated remaining forces in response to the destruction of their supply line and weapons cache. REAPER leadership views COP Seggel as the source of the threat to their operations and intends to destroy or force the withdrawal of the friendly garrison. REAPER has been reinforced from outside the AO and is preparing a deliberate attack.

**1. Composition.** Estimated reinforced platoon (20-30 REAPER personnel) with small arms, RPGs or support weapons, mortar or indirect fire capability, and IEDs. This represents a significant increase from the squad-sized elements previously operating in the area.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER assault force is staging north of COP Seggel in the vicinity of Jacksonville Street. REAPER indirect fire elements are positioned in the dense forest north of Jacksonville Street. Reconnaissance elements are observing COP Seggel from the woodlines to the north and west, mapping defensive positions and reporting to the assault commander. A secondary assault element may approach from the west through the woodlines.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER initiates with indirect fire (mortars) on COP Seggel to suppress defensive positions and force personnel into cover. Following the barrage, a squad-sized assault element attacks south along the Bradenton Avenue corridor from the Jacksonville Street junction while a second element probes the western perimeter through the woodlines. REAPER attempts to breach the perimeter at the ECP and along the northern boundary.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER conducts a coordinated two-axis attack: the main assault from the north along Bradenton Avenue, supported by sustained indirect fire, while a flanking element attacks simultaneously from the west through the woodlines. REAPER employs IEDs or obstacles along Bradenton Avenue south of the COP to prevent friendly withdrawal or reinforcement. The attack is preceded by a feint from the east to draw defensive forces away from the main effort.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company defends COP Seggel to maintain the forward operating base and preserve combat capability for follow-on operations in AO HERRERA.

**3. Adjacent Units.** No reinforcement is available in the next 12 hours. 2nd Platoon remains OPCON to battalion reserve. 3rd Platoon is unable to support. 1st Platoon must defend with organic assets.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians may be displaced by the fighting. Do not engage unidentified personnel without positive identification. Report any civilian presence in or near the defensive perimeter.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

A Company defends COP Seggel (MP 0610 1550) against REAPER counterattack NLT ____ on ____ MAR 26 in order to maintain the forward operating base and preserve combat capability for follow-on operations. 1st Platoon defends.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Retain COP Seggel as the company's forward operating base and deny REAPER the ability to dislodge friendly forces from AO HERRERA.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Prepare defensive positions oriented toward the most dangerous avenues of approach (north and west). (2) Establish observation posts to provide early warning. (3) Maintain the company CP throughout the attack. (4) Defeat the REAPER counterattack. (5) Maintain a reserve / QRF to respond to penetrations or unexpected threats.

**End State:** REAPER counterattack defeated, COP Seggel secure, defensive positions intact, company CP operational, platoon prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon defends COP Seggel from prepared positions. The defense is oriented primarily to the north (Bradenton Avenue corridor and Jacksonville Street junction) and west (woodlines). The platoon establishes fighting positions with overhead cover, observation posts forward of the perimeter for early warning, an ECP controlling the primary entrance, and a reserve/QRF to respond to penetrations. The company CP must remain operational throughout the attack. Indirect fire support is available through company on request. Plan engagement areas along the Bradenton Avenue corridor and the western woodline edge.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon has priority of indirect fires. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Plan defensive fires for the Bradenton Avenue corridor north of COP Seggel, the woodline edges to the north and west, and the Jacksonville Street junction (MP 0602 1565). Final protective fires along the northern and western perimeter.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Platoon (Main Effort — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Defend COP Seggel against REAPER counterattack from the north and west. Establish fighting positions with overhead cover and interlocking fields of fire. Establish observation posts forward of the perimeter to provide early warning of the REAPER approach. Maintain the ECP and control access to the COP. Plan and rehearse engagement areas along the most dangerous avenues of approach. Maintain a reserve / QRF to respond to penetrations or unexpected threats. Keep the company CP operational throughout the attack. Plan indirect fires on likely REAPER assault positions and routes.
- **PURPOSE:** Retain COP Seggel as the company's forward operating base and destroy the REAPER counterattack force to set conditions for follow-on offensive operations.
