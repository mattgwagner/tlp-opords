## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. 1st Platoon occupies COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550). The REAPER counterattack on COP Seggel has been repelled. REAPER suffered significant casualties and has withdrawn its remaining forces to the road junction at Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565), approximately 150 meters north of the COP. This junction is REAPER's last stronghold in AO HERRERA — they are using the intersection and surrounding structures to consolidate, treat casualties, and prepare for either a last stand or withdrawal north out of the AO. The company commander has directed 1st Platoon to seize the junction before REAPER can regroup or escape.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The objective area is the road junction at Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565). Jacksonville Street runs east-west, Bradenton Avenue runs north-south, creating a four-way intersection with limited structures at the corners. Dense woodlines surround the junction on all sides. Bradenton Avenue from COP Seggel to the junction (approximately 150 meters) is open road with limited cover — a direct approach along the road is exposed. The woodlines west of Bradenton Avenue provide a concealed approach from the southwest. The woodlines east of Bradenton Avenue provide a concealed approach from the southeast. Jacksonville Street east and west of the junction provides avenues of withdrawal for REAPER.

   - **Key Terrain:** OBJ HERRERA — the road junction at MP 0602 1565 — controls movement in all four cardinal directions and is the decisive terrain. The woodline edges surrounding the junction provide covered positions for both SBF and assault elements. Bradenton Avenue south of the junction (between OBJ HERRERA and COP Seggel) is open ground that must be crossed or bypassed. Jacksonville Street running east and west from the junction provides REAPER withdrawal routes that must be blocked to prevent escape.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 07 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: High 78°F / Low 63°F (heat cat 1 — green)
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0555
   - Sunrise: 0647
   - Sunset: 1831
   - EENT: 1923

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER has been significantly degraded over the past 48 hours through the loss of their supply line, weapons cache, and the failed counterattack on COP Seggel. Remaining REAPER forces have consolidated at the Jacksonville Street junction — their last defensible position in the AO. Morale is low but they retain the ability to fight from prepared positions.

**1. Composition.** Estimated squad-sized REAPER element (6-10 personnel remaining) with small arms. Limited ammunition. Possible hasty fighting positions at the junction. Indirect fire capability likely exhausted during the counterattack on COP Seggel.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER is concentrated at the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction (MP 0602 1565), oriented south toward COP Seggel along Bradenton Avenue and east-west along Jacksonville Street. Hasty fighting positions at or near the intersection. REAPER likely has observation along Bradenton Avenue between the junction and COP Seggel. Remaining leadership is at the junction coordinating either defense or withdrawal.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER defends the junction with a small security element while the main body prepares to withdraw north along Bradenton Avenue or west along Jacksonville Street. Upon detecting the friendly assault, the security element delays while the main body withdraws. REAPER abandons the position rather than accepting decisive engagement.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has decided to fight to the last at the junction. They have consolidated all remaining ammunition, established interlocking fields of fire across all approaches, and prepared IEDs or obstacles on Bradenton Avenue and in the woodlines. REAPER accepts decisive engagement to inflict maximum casualties before being overrun.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company completes the destruction of REAPER forces in AO HERRERA by seizing the last enemy stronghold at the Jacksonville Street junction.

**3. Adjacent Units.** COP Seggel remains the base of operations. Elements not conducting the assault maintain COP security.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians may be present in the vicinity of the junction, particularly along Jacksonville Street. Positively identify targets. Report civilian presence immediately. Avoid unnecessary destruction of infrastructure at the intersection.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Destroy the last organized REAPER force in AO HERRERA and seize control of the Jacksonville Street junction to deny REAPER any remaining foothold in the AO.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Seize and secure OBJ HERRERA (MP 0602 1565). (2) Destroy or capture remaining REAPER personnel. (3) Block REAPER withdrawal routes along Jacksonville Street. (4) Consolidate on the objective and report.

**End State:** OBJ HERRERA seized and secured, REAPER forces in AO HERRERA destroyed or captured, junction under friendly control, platoon consolidated and prepared for follow-on orders. AO HERRERA clear of organized enemy resistance.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon attacks from COP Seggel to seize OBJ HERRERA at the Jacksonville Street / Bradenton Avenue junction. The platoon establishes a support-by-fire position, assaults the objective, and blocks enemy withdrawal. The platoon must maintain security of COP Seggel with a minimal element during the assault. Upon seizure, the platoon consolidates and reorganizes on the objective and reports to higher. Indirect fire support is available through company on request.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon has priority of indirect fires. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Plan suppressive fires on the objective and blocking fires on Jacksonville Street east and west of the junction to prevent REAPER withdrawal.
