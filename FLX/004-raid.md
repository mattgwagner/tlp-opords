## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. 1st Platoon occupies COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550). The ambush along Bradenton Avenue was successful — documents and a map captured from the REAPER resupply element reveal a weapons and supply cache at a position east of COP Seggel in the vicinity of MP 0611 1530. The cache includes ammunition, IED-making materials, communications equipment, and food stores. Intelligence indicates the cache is guarded by a small REAPER security element and is critical to REAPER's ability to sustain operations in AO HERRERA.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The area east of COP Seggel transitions from dense woodlines to a cluster of structures and storage containers in the vicinity of MP 0611 1530. The approach from COP Seggel moves east through dense woodlines with limited visibility (under 50 meters). An improved road connects the COP area to the cache site. The cache site itself consists of several structures and shipping containers in a partially cleared area, surrounded by woodlines on all sides. Fields of fire are limited to the immediate clearing around the structures. Woodlines provide concealed approach routes from the west and south.

   - **Key Terrain:** The cache site (vicinity MP 0611 1530) is in a partially cleared area with structures providing concealment for stored materials and defending personnel. The woodline edge west of the cache site offers concealed ORP and assault positions. The improved road connecting the COP area to the cache site is the most direct route but also the most likely to be observed or interdicted.

**2. Weather.** *(Planning estimates for 06 MAR — update day-of)*
   - Skies: Partly cloudy
   - Temperature: High 78°F / Low 63°F (heat cat 1 — green)
   - Winds: East at 10-15 mph
   - Chance of precipitation: 20%
   - BMNT: 0557
   - Sunrise: 0648
   - Sunset: 1831
   - EENT: 1922

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
Captured intelligence confirms REAPER is storing weapons, ammunition, IED materials, and supplies at the cache site. The cache is critical to REAPER sustainment — its destruction will significantly degrade their ability to conduct operations in AO HERRERA.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 3-5 REAPER personnel guarding the cache site, equipped with small arms and communications equipment. The guards maintain a low profile to avoid detection and are unlikely to have prepared elaborate defensive positions.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER security element at the cache site provides close-in security and monitors approaches. They are likely positioned within or adjacent to the structures to maintain concealment. REAPER may have a single observation post along the improved road east of COP Seggel to provide early warning. Additional REAPER elements in the AO may respond within 30-60 minutes if alerted.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER security element detects the friendly approach, transmits an alert, and attempts to withdraw east with high-value items (radios, documents) while abandoning the bulk supplies. REAPER avoids decisive engagement to preserve the guard force.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has reinforced the cache site after losing the supply element in the ambush, anticipating a follow-on attack. A reinforced squad (8-10 personnel) defends the cache from prepared positions within the structures while a flanking element maneuvers through the woodlines south of the site to cut off the friendly withdrawal route.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Company Mission.** A Company destroys REAPER combat capability in AO HERRERA by eliminating key logistics infrastructure.

**3. Adjacent Units.** COP Seggel remains manned and defended during the raid. Elements not conducting the raid maintain security at the COP.

### e. Civil Considerations
The cache site area may contain civilian structures or materials. Avoid unnecessary destruction of civilian property. Positively identify all targets. Report any civilian presence immediately.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

A Company destroys REAPER weapons and supply cache (vicinity MP 0611 1530) NLT ____ on ____ MAR 26 in order to degrade REAPER combat capability in AO HERRERA. 1st Platoon conducts the raid.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Destroy REAPER's logistics infrastructure to deny them the ability to sustain operations in AO HERRERA.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Seize the cache site and eliminate the REAPER security element. (2) Destroy all weapons, ammunition, and IED-making materials. (3) Collect all documents, electronics, and materials of intelligence value before destroying the cache. (4) Withdraw to COP Seggel before REAPER can reinforce.

**End State:** Cache site destroyed, REAPER security element eliminated or displaced, intelligence materials collected, platoon returned to COP Seggel, COP security maintained throughout.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon departs COP Seggel, moves to an ORP, conducts a leader's reconnaissance of the cache site, raids the objective to eliminate the security element and destroy the cache, and withdraws to COP Seggel. Time on the objective is critical — search, collect intelligence, destroy the cache, and withdraw before REAPER can respond. The platoon must maintain security of COP Seggel with elements not conducting the raid. Indirect fire support is available through company on request.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Platoon has priority of indirect fires. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Priority of fires to the assault element during the raid.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Platoon (Main Effort — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** Depart COP Seggel and move to an ORP in the vicinity of the cache site. Conduct a leader's reconnaissance. Raid the REAPER cache at vicinity MP 0611 1530 — eliminate the security element, secure the site, search all structures and containers. Collect all documents, maps, electronics, and items of intelligence value. Destroy all weapons, ammunition, and IED materials. Withdraw to COP Seggel via a covered route.
- **PURPOSE:** Destroy REAPER's logistics base to deny them the ability to sustain combat operations in AO HERRERA and exploit captured intelligence for follow-on operations.

**1a. 2nd Squad (Assault Element — Main Effort):**

- **TASK:** Assault and seize the REAPER cache site at vicinity MP 0611 1530. Eliminate the security element. Systematically search all structures and containers — collect all documents, maps, electronics, and items of intelligence value BEFORE destroying cache materials. Destroy all weapons, ammunition, and IED materials. Manage time on the objective — complete search and destruction within the allocated time. Withdraw to the ORP upon completion.
- **PURPOSE:** Seize and exploit the cache to deny REAPER logistics capability and gather intelligence for follow-on operations.

**1b. 1st Squad (Supporting Effort — Isolation):**

- **TASK:** Establish isolation positions around the cache site to prevent REAPER reinforcement or escape. Block the most likely reinforcement routes from the north and west. Provide early warning of approaching enemy forces. Be prepared to support 2nd Squad's withdrawal from the objective if REAPER reinforces. Maintain security of the ORP.
- **PURPOSE:** Isolate the objective so 2nd Squad can conduct the raid without interference from REAPER reinforcement.

**1c. Company HQ:**

- **TASK:** Maintain CP operations at COP Seggel. Track the raid operation on the battle board. Process reports and coordinate indirect fire. Remaining company garrison elements maintain COP security (notional).
- **PURPOSE:** Provide command and control for the operation and maintain the company CP.
