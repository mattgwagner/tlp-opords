## 1. SITUATION

Recon patrols (OPORD 002) report a suspected REAPER observation post in a structure approximately 200 meters west of COP Seggel in the woodline vicinity MP 0580 1550. The OP has line of sight to the COP's western perimeter and the ECP along Bradenton Avenue. Recon elements observed antenna wire, fresh foot traffic, and disturbed vegetation consistent with a recently established position. The OP is likely reporting our defensive layout, security rotation, and patrol patterns to REAPER higher.

**Enemy:** Estimated 2-3 REAPER personnel with small arms, radio, and observation equipment. They are monitoring, not fighting — expect them to attempt withdrawal when detected. A hasty fighting position may be present but the position is not fortified.

**Friendly:** COP Seggel remains manned. Elements not conducting the clearance maintain COP security.
