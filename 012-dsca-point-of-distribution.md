## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Bay County, Florida. Hurricane DELTA made landfall 72-96 hours ago. Emergency supplies have arrived at the Bay County Staging Area. PODs are being established throughout the affected area to provide relief supplies directly to civilians.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** POD Site ALPHA is located at Panama City High School, featuring a large parking lot suitable for drive-through operations. The site has defined entry points from the main road and exit to secondary streets. Surrounding area is residential with significant hurricane damage.

   - **Key Terrain:** POD Site ALPHA (decisive terrain), entry control point on main road, parking lot distribution lanes, exit routes, covered areas for supply staging.

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear to partly cloudy, temperature 80-90°F, humidity 70-80%. Heat casualties are a concern for both Soldiers and civilians.

### c. Civil Considerations
Civilians in Bay County are stressed—many have been without adequate food, water, or ice for 3-4 days. Expect high demand and emotional civilians. Media may be present. Other relief organizations may be operating nearby.

**1. Expected Demand:** POD Site ALPHA is expected to serve 500-1000 households during operational hours.

**2. Population Characteristics:** Diverse population including elderly, families with children, disabled individuals, non-English speakers. Some may be aggressive or desperate.

**3. Special Considerations:**
   - Elderly/disabled may have mobility limitations
   - Some households may have special medical needs (insulin requiring ice)
   - Large families or group homes may request additional supplies
   - Walk-up civilians (no vehicle) will need accommodation
