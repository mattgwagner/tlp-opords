**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #012 / CODE NAME: "HURRICANE DELTA POD OPS"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Moderate | **Recommended Phase:** WALK (Blocks 2-3), RUN (Day/Night Iterations)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to establish and operate a Point of Distribution (POD) at a designated location in Bay County to distribute emergency supplies to affected civilians in support of Hurricane DELTA relief operations.
>
> **Destination:** Designated POD site in Bay County, FL (school parking lot, church, or similar large paved area).
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will establish POD site, set up traffic flow pattern, distribute emergency supplies (water, ice, MREs, tarps) to affected civilians, maintain supply accountability, coordinate resupply, and transition or close POD on order.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD emphasizes logistics, crowd/traffic management, supply accountability, and interaction with distressed civilians. Tests leadership under sustained operations with continuous civilian contact. Good for static training iterations.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 90 minutes (simulated). AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Supplies running low before scheduled resupply (prioritization decisions).
> - Aggressive or desperate civilians demanding more than allocation.
> - Civilians without vehicles (walk-up distribution requests).
> - Media presence requesting interviews or filming operations.
> - Local officials requesting priority distribution for specific groups.
> - Medical emergency at POD site (heat casualty, diabetic emergency, etc.).
> - Requests exceeding distribution limits (large families, group homes).
> - Language barriers with non-English speaking civilians.
> - Rumors spreading about POD closure causing crowd surge.
> - Vehicle breakdown in distribution lane blocking traffic flow.
> - Power outage affecting any electronic tracking/communication.
> - Other agencies (Red Cross, FEMA, church groups) arriving to coordinate or set up adjacent.
> - Civilian complaints about wait times or distribution amounts.
> - Suspected fraud (same vehicle returning for additional supplies).
>
> **NOTE:** This is a DSCA operation. Security awareness is important due to high-value supplies and stressed civilian population, but there is no enemy threat.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Bay County, Florida. Hurricane DELTA made landfall 72-96 hours ago. Emergency supplies have arrived at the Bay County Staging Area. Points of Distribution are being established throughout the affected area to provide relief supplies directly to civilians.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The POD site is located at [designated location - school, church, or large parking area] in Bay County. The site features a large paved area suitable for vehicle traffic flow, with defined entry and exit points. Surrounding area includes residential neighborhoods and commercial areas affected by hurricane damage.

   - **Key Terrain:** POD site (the decisive terrain), entry control point, distribution point, exit lane, staging area for supply vehicles, command post location.

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear to partly cloudy, temperature 80-90°F, humidity 70-80%. Heat casualties are a concern for both Soldiers and civilians. Ensure hydration and shade when possible.

### c. Civil Considerations
Civilians in the area are stressed, without power, and in need of basic supplies. Many have been without adequate food, water, or ice for 3-4 days. Expect high demand and emotional civilians. Some may be aggressive or desperate. Others may be elderly, disabled, or have special needs. Media may be present. Other relief organizations may be operating nearby.

**1. Population.** POD is expected to serve approximately 500-1000 households during operational hours. Expect diverse population including elderly, families with children, disabled individuals, and non-English speakers.

**2. Expectations.** Civilians expect fair, efficient distribution. Long wait times or perceived unfairness may cause frustration. Clear communication about distribution limits and procedures is essential.

**3. Special Needs.** Some civilians may have medical conditions, mobility limitations, or language barriers. Be prepared to accommodate reasonable requests while maintaining fairness.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF, supporting the Florida National Guard Joint Task Force – Hurricane DELTA.

**2. Mission.** A Company operates multiple POD sites in Bay County to distribute emergency relief supplies to affected civilians.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Distribute supplies fairly and efficiently to maximize the number of households served. Treat all civilians with dignity and respect. Maintain accountability of supplies. Coordinate with other agencies as needed. Report issues and needs to enable resupply and support.

### e. Attachments and Detachments
None.
