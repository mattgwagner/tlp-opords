## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the crossroads at MP 0600 1530 and surrounding woodlines, bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the railroad tracks, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** OBJ FLUNKER at MP 0600 1530 is decisive for controlling movement through the area. The adjacent woodlines provide concealment for the assault and support elements. Elevated ground to the north and south offers observation and fields of fire.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of a lightly armed irregular force, likely affiliated with a regional militia group. They are equipped with small arms, possible support weapons, and have experience operating in rural environments. They are capable of basic convoy operations and may attempt to reinforce or withdraw if engaged.

**1. Composition.** 2 vehicles, 6-8 REAPER personnel, AK-47s, possible support weapons (e.g., HMG).

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are typically dispersed in small groups along key supply routes and maintain a low profile to avoid detection. They are prepared to consolidate quickly at critical points if threatened and may use scouts or lookouts to monitor friendly movement.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** Upon initiation of the ambush, REAPER forces return limited, inaccurate fire, then rapidly withdraw along a secondary route to avoid further engagement. They may abandon vehicles or wounded, and attempt to regroup at a safe distance. Reinforcements are unlikely to arrive in time to decisively affect the engagement.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** A nearby REAPER quick reaction force rapidly reinforces the ambushed convoy, coordinating a counterattack with flanking or encirclement maneuvers against the platoon. REAPER forces employ indirect fire or IEDs to disrupt friendly withdrawal and attempts to inflict maximum casualties before friendly forces can break contact.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts ambush operations to disable REAPER supply route in AO COTTO.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Destroy REAPER convoy and seize supplies to ensure safe passage for friendly forces.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians frequent the area. Ambush must minimize risk to non-combatants and avoid civilian casualties to maintain good relations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts an ambush at OBJ FLUNKER (MP 0600 1530) NLT ____ in order to destroy REAPER forces and disrupt REAPER supply lines.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**i) Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon destroys REAPER convoy and seizes supplies to disrupt REAPER logistics and ensure safe passage for friendly forces.

**ii) Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to destroy REAPER forces and disrupt REAPER supply lines to prevent REAPER resupply and maintain friendly freedom of movement in AO COTTO.

**iii) End State.** REAPER convoy is destroyed, supplies are seized, REAPER supply route is disrupted, and friendly forces maintain freedom of movement through AO COTTO.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon establishes an objective rally point (ORP), moves to the ambush site, and sets up a linear ambush along REAPER's expected route of movement. 1st Squad serves as the assault element, initiating the ambush and destroying REAPER forces. 2nd Squad acts as the support element, providing suppressive fire and isolating the objective. 3rd Squad serves as the security element, securing the flanks and rear, and preventing REAPER reinforcement or escape. Upon completion, the platoon withdraws in an organized manner to the ORP.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Squads move rapidly to set up the ambush position before REAPER arrival.
- Ambush executed in linear formation: 1st Squad leads assault, 2nd Squad provides flanking support, 3rd Squad maintains observation and security against reinforcements.

### d. Scheme of Fires
1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has been allocated two mortar targets for planning: AB001 and AB002. 2nd Squad has priority for 81mm HE mortars on order.

### e. Tasks to Subordinate Units
