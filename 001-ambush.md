**THIS IS A TRAINING OPERATION ORDER. FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**

**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #001 / CODE NAME: "AMBUSH AT CROSSROADS"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> Mission Summary: 1st Platoon is tasked to conduct a linear ambush along a key supply route to destroy enemy forces and disrupt enemy logistics.
>
> Destination: Crossroads at MP 0615 1550, AO Starke.
>
> Actions on Objective: Platoon will establish an ORP, move to the ambush site, set up assault, support, and security elements, initiate the ambush on the enemy convoy, and withdraw in an organized manner.
>
> OPFOR/Training Wrinkles: OPFOR should simulate a lightly armed convoy with the ability to reinforce or withdraw. Consider introducing a civilian vehicle or non-combatant presence to test ROE and decision-making. OPFOR may attempt to flank or counterattack if the ambush is detected early. Cadre can inject communication or equipment failures, or unexpected changes in convoy timing to challenge the platoon's flexibility and adaptability.

**1. SITUATION.**

a. Area of Interest. Northeast Florida, Clay County in the vicinity of Starke (IVO Starke), designated as AO Starke.

b. Area of Operations.

1. Terrain. Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   a. Key Terrain: The crossroads at MP 0615 1550 is decisive for controlling movement through the area and is the planned ambush site. The adjacent woodlines provide concealment for the assault and support elements. Elevated ground to the north and south offers observation and fields of fire, while a concealed withdrawal route to the west enables a safe exit after the ambush.

2. Weather. Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

c. Enemy Forces. The enemy consists of a lightly armed irregular force, likely affiliated with a regional militia group. They are equipped with small arms, possible support weapons, and have experience operating in rural environments. They are capable of basic convoy operations and may attempt to reinforce or withdraw if engaged.

1. Composition. 2 vehicles, 6-8 personnel, AK-47s, possible support weapons (e.g., HMG - Heavy Machine Gun).

2. Disposition. Enemy forces are typically dispersed in small groups along key supply routes and maintain a low profile to avoid detection. They are prepared to consolidate quickly at critical points if threatened and may use scouts or lookouts to monitor friendly movement.

3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA). Upon initiation of the ambush, the enemy returns limited, inaccurate fire, then rapidly withdraws along a secondary route to avoid further engagement. They may abandon vehicles or wounded, and attempt to regroup at a safe distance. Reinforcements are unlikely to arrive in time to decisively affect the engagement.

4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA). A nearby enemy quick reaction force rapidly reinforces the ambushed convoy, coordinating a counterattack with flanking or encirclement maneuvers against the platoon. The enemy may employ indirect fire or IEDs to disrupt friendly withdrawal and attempt to inflict maximum casualties before friendly forces can break contact.

d. Friendly Forces.

1. Higher Headquarters: A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

2. Mission. A Company conducts ambush operations to disable enemy supply route in AO Blanding.

3. Commander's Intent. Destroy enemy convoy and seize supplies to ensure safe passage for friendly forces.

e. Civil Considerations. Local civilians frequent the area. Ambush must minimize risk to non-combatants and avoid civilian casualties to maintain good relations.

f. Attachments and Detachments. None.

**2. MISSION.**

1st Platoon conducts an ambush at the crossroads (MP 0615 1550) NLT ____ in order to destroy enemy forces and disrupt enemy supply lines.

**3. EXECUTION.**

a. Concept of Operations. 1st Platoon establishes an objective rally point (ORP), moves to the ambush site, and sets up a linear ambush along the enemy's expected route of movement. 1st Squad serves as the assault element, initiating the ambush and destroying the enemy. 2nd Squad acts as the support element, providing suppressive fire and isolating the objective. 3rd Squad serves as the security element, securing the flanks and rear, and preventing enemy reinforcement or escape. Upon completion, the platoon withdraws in an organized manner to the ORP.

b. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver.

- Squads move rapidly to set up the ambush position before enemy arrival.
- Ambush executed in V-formation: 1st Squad leads, 2nd Squad provides flanking support, 3rd Squad maintains observation and security against reinforcements.

c. Scheme of Fires. 1st Squad has priority for 60mm mortars; 2nd Squad for 81mm HE mortars on order.

2. 2nd Squad:

   **TASK:** Provide flanking and suppressive fire during the ambush, and be prepared to maneuver to block or destroy enemy reinforcements.

   **PURPOSE:** Enable 1st Squad to destroy the convoy and prevent enemy escape or reinforcement.

3. 3rd Squad:
