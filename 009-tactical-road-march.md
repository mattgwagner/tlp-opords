> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Lower | **Recommended Phase:** WALK (Blocks 1-2), RUN (Day Iterations)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to conduct a tactical road march from the assembly area to a designated release point in order to position the platoon for follow-on operations.
>
> **Destination:** Release Point (RP) THUNDER at MP 0615 1560, AO COTTO.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will conduct a tactical road march using appropriate movement formations and techniques, maintain security throughout movement, conduct security halts as required, and arrive at the release point prepared for follow-on operations.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD is ideal for early TLP training due to its straightforward mission focus. Candidates concentrate on movement planning, order of march, security during movement, and actions at halts without the complexity of actions on the objective. Good introduction to terrain association and route planning.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Introduce unexpected obstacles or route changes requiring alternate route selection.
> - Simulate enemy reconnaissance or contact during movement to test security procedures.
> - Inject equipment failures, casualties, or stragglers during movement.
> - Test actions at danger areas (road crossings, open areas, water obstacles).
> - Cadre can inject time constraints or priority changes to test adaptability.
> - Test candidate's ability to maintain accountability and control during extended movement.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. The route of march passes through AO COTTO, bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the railroad tracks, and to the west by the pine forest edge.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   - **Key Terrain:** The route of march includes several danger areas: a road crossing at MP 0605 1545, an open area near MP 0608 1550, and a creek crossing at MP 0612 1555. RP THUNDER at MP 0615 1560 provides good concealment and defensible terrain for the transition to follow-on operations.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Heat casualties are a concern; ensure adequate hydration.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces consist of small reconnaissance elements operating throughout AO COTTO. They are equipped with small arms and communications equipment, capable of observing and reporting friendly movement. They may attempt to interdict or delay friendly forces if opportunity presents.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 2-4 REAPER reconnaissance personnel, small arms, radios, in mobile or static observation positions.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER reconnaissance elements are dispersed throughout the area, using terrain and vegetation for concealment. They monitor likely routes of movement and report friendly activity. They avoid direct engagement but may emplace obstacles or conduct harassing actions.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER reconnaissance observes and reports friendly movement without engaging. They maintain standoff distance and avoid detection, focusing on intelligence collection rather than direct action.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER elements establish a hasty ambush along the route of march, coordinating with additional forces to fix and engage the platoon at a danger area or choke point. They attempt to inflict casualties and delay friendly movement.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company repositions forces to AO COTTO to prepare for offensive operations against REAPER forces.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Move the platoon to RP THUNDER safely and efficiently, maintaining security and readiness for follow-on operations.

### e. Civil Considerations
Local civilians may be present along the route of march. Movement must minimize disruption and avoid contact with non-combatants to maintain operational security and good relations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a tactical road march from the assembly area to RP THUNDER using traveling overwatch or bounding overwatch as the situation dictates. The platoon moves in a column formation with squads maintaining proper intervals. Security is maintained throughout movement with point, flank, and rear security elements. The platoon conducts security halts at designated checkpoints and at all danger areas. Upon arrival at RP THUNDER, the platoon establishes a short security halt, confirms accountability, and prepares for follow-on operations.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
