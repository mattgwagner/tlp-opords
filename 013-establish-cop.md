**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #013 / CODE NAME: "ESTABLISH COP"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Higher | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Capstone LFX)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to clear and occupy the facilities at COP Seggel, establish entrance and perimeter security, set up and operate the company command post, and prepare the COP as the base of operations for follow-on missions throughout the AO.
>
> **Destination:** COP Seggel, vicinity MP 0600 1550, AO HERRERA. Facility was previously occupied by host nation forces and has been vacated. Enemy presence is unknown.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will conduct a leader's reconnaissance, systematically clear all facilities, establish entrance control and perimeter security, designate and establish the company command post with battle tracking and radio communications, and prepare defensive positions to hold the COP for a minimum of 48 hours without relief.
>
> **Capstone LFX:** This OPORD is designed as the opening operation of an extended LFX. Once established, COP Seggel becomes the persistent base of operations for the remainder of the exercise. All subsequent missions (patrols, reconnaissance, raids) will originate from and return to COP Seggel. Write subsequent OPORDs and FRAGO's to task from this location.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD tests multi-phase planning (offense to defense transition), building clearing under uncertainty, CP establishment and operations, battle tracking, communications management, sustainment planning for extended operations, and defensive planning against indirect fire and counterattack threats. The CP establishment requirement evaluates whether candidates can stand up a functioning command post that supports company and platoon operations across the AO.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes for initial clearing and occupation. CP operations and defensive posture are sustained for the duration of the LFX.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Vary REAPER presence during clearing: empty facility, observation element only, or occupied and defended.
> - Simulate indirect fire (mortar) attack after occupation to test overhead cover and dispersion planning.
> - Introduce host nation materials left behind (booby traps, usable supplies, intelligence value items).
> - Use civilian role-players approaching the COP to test ROE and entrance control procedures.
> - Inject resupply delays beyond 48 hours to stress sustainment planning.
> - Issue follow-on FRAGOs from the COP to test CP operations and battle tracking under pressure.
> - Test communications management by requiring simultaneous monitoring of company and platoon nets.
> - Inject casualty scenarios requiring MEDEVAC coordination from the COP.
> - Simulate REAPER counterattack probe to test defensive posture and QRF employment.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. COP Seggel is a facility complex at MP 0600 1550 within AO HERRERA. The facility was previously occupied by host nation security forces who have departed the area. It is unclear whether REAPER forces have moved to occupy or observe the facility since the host nation withdrawal.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** COP Seggel is situated in a mixed urban and semi-rural environment with multiple buildings, hardened structures, and limited open areas. The surrounding area includes adjacent woodlines, open fields, and road networks that serve as avenues of approach. Buildings within the facility provide defensible positions with observation and fields of fire, but also present clearing challenges with multiple rooms and potential dead space. The facility perimeter includes entrance points that must be controlled and open areas that may expose personnel to observation and indirect fire.

   - **Key Terrain:** The facility complex at COP Seggel is the decisive terrain. Entrance points to the facility are critical for controlling access. Adjacent elevated terrain and woodlines offer observation of the facility and may be used by REAPER for reconnaissance or indirect fire positioning. Road junctions in the vicinity provide avenues of approach for both friendly resupply and enemy reinforcement. Buildings within the complex that offer overhead cover are critical for CP operations and protection against indirect fire.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during thunderstorms. Plan for sustained operations through day and night cycles.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are an irregular force operating throughout the AO. Following the host nation withdrawal from COP Seggel, REAPER may have moved forces to observe, occupy, or exploit the vacated facility. They are capable of conducting reconnaissance, small-unit attacks, indirect fire, and coordinated assaults. REAPER has demonstrated interest in controlling key infrastructure to stage their own operations.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 4-8 REAPER personnel in the vicinity, small arms (AK-47s), possible mortar or indirect fire capability, IEDs, and communications equipment. A larger REAPER element of up to platoon size may be available to reinforce within 4-6 hours.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces may have a small security or observation element at or near the facility. They are likely monitoring the facility and surrounding routes. If REAPER has occupied the facility, they will have established hasty defensive positions. If not in the facility, they are likely observing from nearby concealed positions and reporting to higher elements.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER has a small observation element monitoring the facility. Upon detecting friendly approach, REAPER observers withdraw, report friendly strength and disposition to higher, and monitor from a distance. REAPER conducts harassing indirect fire to disrupt occupation and probes the perimeter with small reconnaissance elements to assess defensive posture.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has occupied and fortified COP Seggel as a staging base for their own operations. Upon friendly approach, REAPER defends the facility while calling for reinforcement. A platoon-sized REAPER element conducts a coordinated counterattack to retake the facility, employing indirect fire to suppress defensive positions while assault elements attack from multiple directions to overwhelm the perimeter before friendly forces can consolidate.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company establishes a forward presence in AO HERRERA to deny REAPER freedom of movement and enable follow-on offensive operations. COP Seggel will serve as the company command post and base of operations for sustained operations throughout the AO.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Seize and secure COP Seggel to establish a persistent forward operating base. The facility must be cleared, occupied, and prepared to support company-level operations for a minimum of 48 hours. The platoon must be prepared to defend the COP against REAPER counterattack while simultaneously establishing the command post and supporting follow-on missions.

### e. Civil Considerations
Host nation security forces recently vacated the facility. Host nation civilians or contractors may be in the surrounding area. Any host nation personnel encountered should be treated respectfully, identified, and reported to higher. Materials and equipment left behind by host nation forces should be inventoried and reported. Avoid damage to facility infrastructure that will be used for sustained operations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon clears and occupies COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550) NLT ____ to establish entrance and perimeter security and establish the company command post in order to support follow-on operations in AO HERRERA.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**1. Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon secures COP Seggel through deliberate clearing of all facilities, establishes a defensible perimeter with entrance control, and stands up a functioning company command post capable of supporting operations throughout the AO.

**2. Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to establish a persistent forward operating base at COP Seggel to enable company-level command and control, provide a secure base for follow-on operations, and deny REAPER use of the facility.

**3. End State.** All facilities at COP Seggel are cleared and secured, entrance and perimeter security are established, the company command post is operational with battle tracking and radio communications on company and platoon nets, defensive positions are prepared to withstand indirect fire and ground attack, and the platoon is postured to sustain operations for a minimum of 48 hours and support follow-on missions from the COP.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a three-phase operation to establish COP Seggel. In **Phase 1 (Approach)**, the platoon moves to the vicinity of COP Seggel, establishes a security halt, and the PL conducts a leader's reconnaissance to assess enemy presence and confirm the scheme of maneuver. In **Phase 2 (Clear)**, the platoon systematically clears all facilities within COP Seggel, with one squad as the assault element, one squad in support by fire, and one squad providing outer security. In **Phase 3 (Occupy and Establish)**, the platoon transitions to defensive operations, establishing entrance control, perimeter security with fighting positions, the company command post with battle tracking and communications, and priorities of work for sustained operations. The platoon maintains a quick reaction force capability to respond to REAPER probes or counterattack throughout.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Platoon moves to COP Seggel using a covered and concealed route, maintaining tactical movement techniques.
- Platoon halts short of the facility; PL conducts leader's reconnaissance with a small security element to assess enemy presence and confirm entry points.
- Upon PL order, assault element moves to clear facilities systematically while support element provides overwatch from a position covering the primary entrance and likely enemy positions.
- Security element maintains outer cordon to prevent enemy reinforcement or escape during clearing.
- Upon confirmation that facilities are clear, squads transition to assigned defensive sectors and begin establishing fighting positions.
- Entrance control point established at the primary entrance with positive identification procedures.

### d. Scheme of Fires
Support element has priority of fires during Phase 2 (Clear). Upon transition to Phase 3 (Occupy), priority of fires shifts to the most dangerous avenue of approach as determined during the leader's reconnaissance. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Defensive fires planned for likely REAPER avenues of approach, with particular attention to positions that could support indirect fire against the COP.

### e. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad:**

- **TASK:** Serve as the assault element during Phase 2 to systematically clear all buildings and facilities within COP Seggel. Upon completion of clearing, transition to defend the northern sector of the COP perimeter, establishing fighting positions with overhead cover and interlocking fields of fire.
- **PURPOSE:** Ensure all facilities are clear of enemy forces to enable safe occupation, then provide security of the northern perimeter against REAPER approach.
- **END STATE:** All assigned buildings are cleared, northern defensive sector is established with fighting positions providing overhead cover, and squad is prepared for sustained defensive operations.

**2. 2nd Squad:**

- **TASK:** Provide support by fire during Phase 2 from a position covering the primary entrance and likely enemy positions within the facility. Upon completion of clearing, establish and man the entrance control point at the primary entrance to COP Seggel, conduct positive identification of all personnel entering the facility, and provide observation of the eastern and western approaches.
- **PURPOSE:** Suppress enemy resistance during clearing operations, then control access to the COP and provide early warning of REAPER activity along the eastern and western avenues of approach.
- **END STATE:** Entrance control point is established with positive identification procedures, eastern and western approaches are under observation, and squad is prepared to deny unauthorized entry.

**3. 3rd Squad:**

- **TASK:** Provide outer security during Phase 2 to prevent enemy reinforcement or escape. Upon completion of clearing, defend the southern sector of the COP perimeter and serve as the platoon quick reaction force, prepared to reinforce any sector under attack or respond to REAPER activity.
- **PURPOSE:** Isolate the objective during clearing, then provide security of the southern perimeter and immediate response capability to reinforce threatened sectors.
- **END STATE:** Southern defensive sector is established with fighting positions, squad is prepared to deploy as QRF on order, and withdrawal routes are identified and briefed.

**4. Platoon Sergeant:**

- **TASK:** Upon completion of Phase 2, designate and establish the company command post within a hardened building at COP Seggel. Establish battle tracking, maintain radio communications on both company net (FH NET ID 600) and platoon net (FH NET ID 601), coordinate logistics and sustainment for the platoon, and manage the rest and security plan for sustained 48-hour operations.
- **PURPOSE:** Enable company-level command and control from COP Seggel and sustain platoon operations for the duration of the mission.
