**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #013 / CODE NAME: "ESTABLISH COP"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Higher | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Capstone LFX)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to clear and occupy the facilities at COP Seggel, establish entrance and perimeter security, set up and operate the company command post, and prepare the COP as the base of operations for follow-on missions throughout the AO.
>
> **Destination:** COP Seggel, vicinity MP 0600 1550, AO HERRERA. Facility was previously occupied by host nation forces and has been vacated. Enemy presence is unknown.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will conduct a leader's reconnaissance, systematically clear all facilities, establish entrance control and perimeter security, designate and establish the company command post with battle tracking and radio communications, and prepare defensive positions to hold the COP for a minimum of 48 hours without relief.
>
> **Capstone LFX:** This OPORD is designed as the opening operation of an extended LFX. Once established, COP Seggel becomes the persistent base of operations for the remainder of the exercise. All subsequent missions (patrols, reconnaissance, raids) will originate from and return to COP Seggel. Write subsequent OPORDs and FRAGO's to task from this location.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD tests multi-phase planning (offense to defense transition), building clearing under uncertainty, CP establishment and operations, battle tracking, communications management, sustainment planning for extended operations, and defensive planning against indirect fire and counterattack threats. The CP establishment requirement evaluates whether candidates can stand up a functioning command post that supports company and platoon operations across the AO.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes for initial clearing and occupation. CP operations and defensive posture are sustained for the duration of the LFX.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Vary REAPER presence during clearing: empty facility, observation element only, or occupied and defended.
> - Simulate indirect fire (mortar) attack after occupation to test overhead cover and dispersion planning.
> - Introduce host nation materials left behind (booby traps, usable supplies, intelligence value items).
> - Use civilian role-players approaching the COP to test ROE and entrance control procedures.
> - Inject resupply delays beyond 48 hours to stress sustainment planning.
> - Issue follow-on FRAGOs from the COP to test CP operations and battle tracking under pressure.
> - Test communications management by requiring simultaneous monitoring of company and platoon nets.
> - Inject casualty scenarios requiring MEDEVAC coordination from the COP.
> - Simulate REAPER counterattack probe to test defensive posture and QRF employment.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Camp Blanding Joint Training Center. COP Seggel is a facility complex at MP 0600 1550 within AO HERRERA. The facility was previously occupied by host nation security forces who have departed the area. It is unclear whether REAPER forces have moved to occupy or observe the facility since the host nation withdrawal. The road junction at Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565), approximately 150 meters north of COP Seggel, is a known area of REAPER activity and controls the primary avenue of approach into the AO from the north.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** The AO consists of flat terrain with sandy soils and dense pine and hardwood forests throughout. Thick vegetation and tree canopy severely limit observation and fields of fire except along improved roads and clearings. COP Seggel is a facility complex situated along Bradenton Avenue at MP 0600 1550. Bradenton Avenue runs north-south through the center of the AO, serving as the primary improved road and avenue of approach. Jacksonville Street runs east-west approximately 150 meters north of the COP, intersecting Bradenton Avenue at MP 0602 1565. Clearwater Avenue runs north-south approximately 250 meters west of Bradenton Avenue, providing a secondary avenue of approach from the south and west. The facility complex includes multiple buildings and hardened structures surrounded by dense woodlines on all sides. Open areas within and immediately surrounding the facility provide limited fields of fire along the road corridors, but observation is restricted to under 50 meters in the surrounding woodlines. The dense forest canopy provides concealment for approaching forces but also limits observation from defensive positions within the COP.

   - **Key Terrain:** The facility complex at COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550) is the decisive terrain. The intersection of Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue (MP 0602 1565), approximately 150 meters north of the COP, is key terrain that controls north-south and east-west movement through the AO and represents the most likely avenue of approach for REAPER reinforcement. Bradenton Avenue south of the COP provides a cleared lane of observation and fire along the southern approach. Entrance points to the facility along Bradenton Avenue are critical for controlling access. The dense woodlines surrounding the facility on all sides, particularly to the north and west, offer concealment for REAPER reconnaissance elements or assault forces approaching the COP. Buildings within the complex that provide overhead cover are critical for CP operations and protection against indirect fire.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during thunderstorms. Plan for sustained operations through day and night cycles.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are an irregular force operating throughout the AO. Following the host nation withdrawal from COP Seggel, REAPER may have moved forces to observe, occupy, or exploit the vacated facility. They are capable of conducting reconnaissance, small-unit attacks, indirect fire, and coordinated assaults. REAPER has demonstrated interest in controlling key infrastructure to stage their own operations. REAPER has previously operated in the vicinity of the Jacksonville Street and Bradenton Avenue junction and is familiar with the road network and surrounding woodlines.

**1. Composition.** Estimated 4-8 REAPER personnel in the vicinity, small arms (AK-47s), possible mortar or indirect fire capability, IEDs, and communications equipment. A larger REAPER element of up to platoon size may be available to reinforce within 4-6 hours from the north along Jacksonville Street or through the woodlines north of the COP.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces may have a small security or observation element at or near the facility. They are likely monitoring the facility and surrounding routes, particularly Bradenton Avenue and the road junction at Jacksonville Street (MP 0602 1565). If REAPER has occupied the facility, they will have established hasty defensive positions oriented along Bradenton Avenue and the east-west access roads. If not in the facility, they are likely observing from concealed positions in the dense woodlines north or west of the COP and reporting to higher elements positioned along Jacksonville Street or further north.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER has a small observation element monitoring the facility from the woodline north of COP Seggel, in the vicinity of Jacksonville Street. Upon detecting friendly approach along Bradenton Avenue, REAPER observers withdraw north toward the Jacksonville Street junction or into the woodlines west of the COP, report friendly strength and disposition to higher, and continue to monitor from a distance. REAPER conducts harassing indirect fire from positions in the dense forest north of Jacksonville Street to disrupt occupation and probes the perimeter with small reconnaissance elements approaching through the woodlines to assess defensive posture.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER has occupied and fortified COP Seggel as a staging base for their own operations. Upon friendly approach, REAPER defends the facility while calling for reinforcement from the north. A platoon-sized REAPER element conducts a coordinated counterattack south along Bradenton Avenue and through the woodlines west of the COP, employing indirect fire from positions north of Jacksonville Street to suppress defensive positions while assault elements attack from the north and west to overwhelm the perimeter before friendly forces can consolidate.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company establishes a forward presence in AO HERRERA to deny REAPER freedom of movement and enable follow-on offensive operations. COP Seggel will serve as the company command post and base of operations for sustained operations throughout the AO.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Seize and secure COP Seggel to establish a persistent forward operating base. The facility must be cleared, occupied, and prepared to support company-level operations for a minimum of 48 hours. The platoon must be prepared to defend the COP against REAPER counterattack while simultaneously establishing the command post and supporting follow-on missions.

### e. Civil Considerations
Host nation security forces recently vacated the facility. Host nation civilians or contractors may be in the surrounding area, particularly along Jacksonville Street and the improved roads east of the COP. Any host nation personnel encountered should be treated respectfully, identified, and reported to higher. Materials and equipment left behind by host nation forces should be inventoried and reported. Avoid damage to facility infrastructure that will be used for sustained operations.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon clears and occupies COP Seggel (MP 0600 1550) NLT ____ to establish entrance and perimeter security and establish the company command post in order to support follow-on operations in AO HERRERA.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**1. Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon secures COP Seggel through deliberate clearing of all facilities, establishes a defensible perimeter with entrance control along Bradenton Avenue, and stands up a functioning company command post capable of supporting operations throughout the AO.

**2. Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to establish a persistent forward operating base at COP Seggel to enable company-level command and control, provide a secure base for follow-on operations, and deny REAPER use of the facility.

**3. End State.** All facilities at COP Seggel are cleared and secured, entrance and perimeter security are established with the primary ECP controlling the Bradenton Avenue approach, the company command post is operational with battle tracking and radio communications on company and platoon nets, defensive positions are prepared to withstand indirect fire and ground attack with particular attention to the northern and western approaches, and the platoon is postured to sustain operations for a minimum of 48 hours and support follow-on missions from the COP.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a three-phase operation to establish COP Seggel. In **Phase 1 (Approach)**, the platoon moves north along the woodline west of Bradenton Avenue to the vicinity of COP Seggel, establishes a security halt south of the facility, and the PL conducts a leader's reconnaissance to assess enemy presence and confirm the scheme of maneuver. In **Phase 2 (Clear)**, the platoon systematically clears all facilities within COP Seggel, with one squad as the assault element, one squad in support by fire oriented north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor, and one squad providing outer security in the woodlines to prevent REAPER reinforcement from the north or west. In **Phase 3 (Occupy and Establish)**, the platoon transitions to defensive operations, establishing entrance control along Bradenton Avenue, perimeter security with fighting positions oriented toward the most dangerous avenues of approach (north along Bradenton Avenue toward the Jacksonville Street junction and west through the woodlines), the company command post with battle tracking and communications, and priorities of work for sustained operations. The platoon maintains a quick reaction force capability to respond to REAPER probes or counterattack throughout.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Platoon moves to COP Seggel from the south, using the woodline west of Bradenton Avenue for concealment, maintaining tactical movement techniques.
- Platoon halts short of the facility south of MP 0600 1550; PL conducts leader's reconnaissance with a small security element to assess enemy presence, confirm entry points along Bradenton Avenue, and evaluate the facility for clearing.
- Upon PL order, assault element moves to clear facilities systematically while support element provides overwatch from a position south of the facility covering the Bradenton Avenue corridor and likely enemy positions to the north.
- Security element maintains outer cordon in the woodlines north and west of the facility to prevent enemy reinforcement from the Jacksonville Street area or escape into the dense forest.
- Upon confirmation that facilities are clear, squads transition to assigned defensive sectors and begin establishing fighting positions.
- Entrance control point established at the Bradenton Avenue entrance to the facility with positive identification procedures.

### d. Scheme of Fires
Support element has priority of fires during Phase 2 (Clear), oriented north along the Bradenton Avenue corridor. Upon transition to Phase 3 (Occupy), priority of fires shifts to the northern approach along Bradenton Avenue toward the Jacksonville Street junction, as the most dangerous avenue of approach for REAPER reinforcement. Indirect fire support available through company on request. Defensive fires planned for the Bradenton Avenue corridor (north and south) and the woodlines to the west, with particular attention to positions north of Jacksonville Street that could support REAPER indirect fire against the COP.

### e. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad:**

- **TASK:** Serve as the assault element during Phase 2 to systematically clear all buildings and facilities within COP Seggel. Upon completion of clearing, transition to defend the northern sector of the COP perimeter, establishing fighting positions with overhead cover and interlocking fields of fire oriented north along Bradenton Avenue toward the Jacksonville Street junction (MP 0602 1565) and into the woodlines northeast of the facility.
- **PURPOSE:** Ensure all facilities are clear of enemy forces to enable safe occupation, then provide security of the northern perimeter against REAPER approach along the primary avenue of approach from Jacksonville Street.
- **END STATE:** All assigned buildings are cleared, northern defensive sector is established with fighting positions providing overhead cover and fields of fire covering the Bradenton Avenue corridor north to the Jacksonville Street junction, and squad is prepared for sustained defensive operations.

## APPENDIX 1: OVERHEAD IMAGERY / TERRAIN ANALYSIS

**Classification: UNCLASSIFIED // FOR TRAINING USE ONLY**

### Local Training Area — MilGPS Overhead with Military Grid

![COP Seggel Area — MilGPS Overhead Imagery with MGRS Grid Overlay](cbjtc-lta-milgps.png)

*Source: MilGPS application, satellite imagery with 17R MP MGRS grid overlay. Grid lines at 100m intervals.*

### Key Locations

| Grid (17R MP) | Location | Significance |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| MP 0600 1550 | COP Seggel | Facility complex — objective for clearing and occupation |
| MP 0602 1565 | Jacksonville St / Bradenton Ave junction | Key terrain — controls northern approach, REAPER activity area |
| MP 0600 1560 | Bradenton Ave, 100m north of COP | Northern approach corridor along Bradenton Ave |
| MP 0575 1550 | Clearwater Ave, west of COP | Secondary avenue of approach from the west |
| MP 0600 1540 | Bradenton Ave, south of COP | Southern approach; security halt and SBF position area |

### Avenues of Approach

**1. Primary (NORTH — Most Dangerous):** South along Bradenton Avenue from the Jacksonville Street junction (MP 0602 1565). This is the primary improved road through the AO and provides a direct avenue of approach for REAPER reinforcement from the north. The road corridor provides fields of fire for defenders at the COP but also exposes the northern perimeter.

**2. Secondary (WEST):** East through the dense woodlines from the direction of Clearwater Avenue. Thick pine and hardwood forest provides excellent concealment for dismounted approach but limits movement speed. Observation from the COP into the western woodline is restricted to under 50 meters.

**3. Secondary (SOUTH):** North along Bradenton Avenue from the south. This is the friendly force approach route and also a potential avenue for REAPER flanking movement. The road corridor provides observation for the southern defensive sector.

**4. Secondary (EAST):** West along east-west access roads from the direction of the FOB area (MP 0610 1550). Dense woodlines between the COP and the FOB restrict observation but improved roads provide a direct approach.

### Terrain Analysis Notes

The overhead imagery confirms flat terrain throughout the AO with dense tree canopy providing concealment from aerial observation. Improved roads (Bradenton Avenue, Jacksonville Street, Clearwater Avenue) are clearly visible as the only locations offering extended observation and fields of fire. The facility complex at COP Seggel is situated along Bradenton Avenue with dense woodlines on all sides, consistent with the terrain description in the OPORD. Candidates should note that the dense canopy will limit observation to under 50 meters in the woodlines, making the road corridors critical for both fields of fire and early warning.
