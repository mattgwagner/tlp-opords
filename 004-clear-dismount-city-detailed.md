> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Highest | **Recommended Phase:** RUN (Advanced Iterations - Second Cycle or High Performers)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to clear, seize, and secure the urban terrain known as OBJ FLUNKER. REAPER forces are using this area as a base for operations. The platoon must occupy the city and prevent REAPER from regaining control or using it for future operations.
>
> **Destination:** OBJ FLUNKER, AO HERRERA (urban terrain, grid MP 0611 1530).
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will establish an ORP, move to the city, isolate the objective, clear buildings and key terrain, secure the area, and establish defensive positions to prevent enemy re-infiltration. Assault, support, and security elements will be employed per doctrine.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD has the highest complexity due to MOUT operations. Recommend for second cycle iterations or candidates demonstrating strong TLP proficiency. Requires detailed planning for building clearing, phase lines, and consolidation.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 60 minutes. AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Simulate a determined defense using urban tactics, barricades, and possible IEDs.
> - Introduce non-combatant role-players, civilian presence, or hostages to test ROE.
> - OPFOR may attempt to counterattack, infiltrate, or use underground routes.
> - Inject time-sensitive intelligence, booby traps, or unexpected obstacles.
>
> **NOTE:** UAS/Counter-UAS injects are OPTIONAL and should only be used if authorized by the Commandant and incorporated into the approved POI.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** OBJ FLUNKER is a small urban area with multiple multi-story buildings, narrow streets, alleys, and limited open spaces. The city is surrounded by wooded areas and open fields. Urban terrain provides numerous positions for defense, ambush, and concealment. Buildings offer cover and observation points, while underground routes (sewers, basements) may be used for movement or escape. Limited vehicle access due to debris and barricades.

   - **Key Terrain:** Central plaza (MP 0611 1530), police station, and high-rise building dominate OBJ FLUNKER and are critical for control. Rooftops and intersections provide observation and fields of fire. Main roads and alleyways are likely avenues of approach and withdrawal.

**2. Weather.** Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

### c. Enemy Forces. REAPER: Resistance Elements of Atropia's People's Revolutionary Front
REAPER forces are a well-armed irregular force, using OBJ FLUNKER as a base for operations. They are experienced in urban combat, employ barricades, IEDs, and may use civilians as shields. Capable of rapid movement through buildings and underground routes.

**1. Composition.** 8-10 REAPER combatants, small arms, possible HMG/RPG, IEDs, barricades, and communications equipment.

**2. Disposition.** REAPER forces are dispersed in defensive positions throughout the city, occupying key buildings and intersections. They maintain observation on likely approaches and are prepared to reinforce or withdraw as needed. Possible use of lookouts and early warning systems.

**3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA).** REAPER forces defend key buildings and intersections, using small arms and IEDs to delay friendly advance. If overwhelmed, they withdraw through underground routes or blend with civilians, attempting to regroup outside the city.

**4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA).** REAPER forces launch a coordinated counterattack with reinforcements, using pre-placed IEDs, barricades, and snipers to inflict maximum casualties. They attempt to encircle friendly forces or use hostages to delay operations.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

**2. Mission.** A Company clears and secures OBJ FLUNKER to deny REAPER a base of operations and enable follow-on operations in AO Starke.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Seize and secure OBJ FLUNKER, eliminate REAPER presence, and establish a defensive posture to prevent REAPER re-infiltration.

### e. Civil Considerations
Civilians are present in the city. Minimize risk to non-combatants, avoid collateral damage, and maintain positive relations with local populace.

### f. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon clears, seizes, and secures OBJ FLUNKER (MP 0611 1530) NLT ____ to eliminate REAPER forces, deny REAPER a base of operations, and enable occupation by friendly forces.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**Purpose:** Deny REAPER a base of operations in OBJ FLUNKER and enable friendly occupation of the urban area for follow-on operations in AO HERRERA.

**Key Tasks:** (1) Clear all buildings and key terrain in OBJ FLUNKER. (2) Eliminate REAPER combatants. (3) Establish defensive positions to prevent REAPER re-infiltration.

**End State:** OBJ FLUNKER cleared, REAPER forces eliminated, friendly forces occupying the city in a defensive posture.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts a deliberate clearing operation of OBJ FLUNKER in two phases. In **Phase 1 (Isolate and Clear)**, the platoon moves from the ORP to isolate the objective. The assault element, as the main effort, clears buildings along the main axis while the support element provides overwatch from key intersections. The security element blocks REAPER withdrawal and reinforcement routes. The platoon advances by phase lines, clearing and securing each sector before moving forward. In **Phase 2 (Consolidate)**, the platoon establishes defensive positions to hold the city and prevent re-infiltration.

### c. Scheme of Fires
1st Squad, as the decisive effort, has priority of indirect fires. Mortar support and smoke available through company on request.

### d. Tasks to Subordinate Units

**1. 1st Squad (Assault — Decisive Operation):**

- **TASK:** SP from ORP in squad column. Clear and secure buildings along the main axis of advance through OBJ FLUNKER, beginning at the eastern approach (vic MP 0611 1530). Neutralize REAPER combatants in each structure. Report sectors clear by phase line. Upon consolidation, establish defensive positions in the central plaza area.
- **PURPOSE:** Systematically eliminate REAPER's foothold in the urban area so the platoon can occupy and hold OBJ FLUNKER.

**2. 2nd Squad (Support — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Provide overwatch and suppressive fire from key intersections and rooftops as 1st Squad advances. Shift positions forward as phase lines are cleared. Be prepared to reinforce 1st Squad's clearing effort on order. During consolidation, establish defensive positions covering southern approaches.
- **PURPOSE:** Suppress REAPER fighters in depth so 1st Squad can close on and clear buildings without receiving flanking fire.

**3. 3rd Squad (Security — Shaping Operation):**

- **TASK:** Secure the flanks and rear of the clearing operation. Block likely REAPER withdrawal routes to the north and reinforcement routes from outside the city. Maintain security of cleared sectors as the platoon advances. Monitor for civilian movement and report. During consolidation, establish defensive positions covering northern and western approaches.
- **PURPOSE:** Prevent REAPER from escaping, reinforcing, or re-infiltrating cleared sectors behind the assault element.

### f. Coordinating Instructions

**1. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   1. Engage only confirmed enemy combatants.
   2. Use minimum force necessary to accomplish the mission.
   3. Avoid civilian casualties and minimize collateral damage.
   4. Positively identify targets before firing.
   5. Report civilian casualties immediately.

**2. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR):**
   1. Identify REAPER positions, barricades, and IEDs.
   2. Monitor for REAPER reinforcements or withdrawal attempts.
   3. Assess civilian presence and movement in the city.
   4. Identify underground routes or escape tunnels.

**3. Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR):**
   1. REAPER reinforcements entering the city from outside the cleared area during operations
   2. Civilian concentration preventing use of planned fires or maneuver in a sector
   3. Loss of communication between clearing teams during operations
   4. Discovery of NBC materials or indicators in any structure
   5. Friendly casualty rendering a clearing team combat ineffective

**4. Reporting:**
   - **Report to higher when SP'ing or crossing the line of departure.**
   - **In Position Report:** Upon occupying the ORP or objective.
   - **LACE Report:** At least once during operation and upon consolidation.
