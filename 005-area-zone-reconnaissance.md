Platoon Leader  
Platoon Sergeant  
1st Squad  
2nd Squad  
3rd Squad

**1. SITUATION.**

a. Area of Interest. Clay County, Florida, in the vicinity of Starke and Highway 16. AO COTTO encompasses the area bounded to the north by Highway 16, to the east by the Starke city limits, to the south by the railroad tracks, and to the west by the pine forest edge. Suspected enemy activity centered around MP 0620 1540.

b. Area of Operations.

1. Terrain. Camp Blanding features flat to gently rolling terrain with sandy soils, low-lying areas, and extensive pine and hardwood forests. The area includes open fields, dense underbrush, ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Vegetation provides concealment and limits long-range observation. Roads and trails serve as likely avenues of approach for both friendly and enemy forces. Terrain and soil conditions may restrict vehicle movement, especially in wet areas.

   a. Key Terrain: The suspected enemy position at MP 0620 1540 is the focus of reconnaissance. Elevated ground to the north and south offers observation points. Woodlines provide concealment for reconnaissance elements. A small creek bisects the area, potentially affecting movement and enemy positions.

2. Weather. Warm and humid, partly cloudy skies, temperature around 85°F, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Limited visibility may occur during thunderstorms.

c. Enemy Forces. The enemy consists of a small irregular force, likely operating from concealed positions within AO COTTO. They are equipped with small arms and may have support weapons. They are experienced in local terrain and employ security measures to avoid detection. Recent conflicts have demonstrated the widespread use of UAS (drones) for reconnaissance and attack. Enemy and irregular forces may employ commercial or military drones for surveillance, target acquisition, or direct attack. Platoon leaders and squads must account for potential UAS threats during planning, movement, and actions on the objective. Maintain vigilance for aerial threats, use available cover and concealment, and report any UAS sightings immediately.

1. Composition. Estimated 4-6 personnel, small arms, possible support weapons, in concealed or defensive positions.

2. Disposition. Enemy forces are likely dispersed in small groups throughout the area, using terrain and vegetation for concealment. They maintain security patrols and observation posts to detect friendly reconnaissance. Exact locations unknown - this is the purpose of the reconnaissance mission.

3. Most Probable Course of Action (MPCOA). Enemy maintains static defensive positions or conducts limited patrols within the area. If detected, they attempt to break contact and withdraw rather than engage decisively. They may use decoy positions or false indicators to mislead friendly reconnaissance.

4. Most Dangerous Course of Action (MDCOA). Enemy detects friendly reconnaissance and initiates an ambush or counter-reconnaissance operation. They coordinate with additional elements to encircle or fix the reconnaissance platoon, seeking to prevent intelligence collection or inflict casualties. The enemy uses a UAS to identify friendly positions and direct counter-reconnaissance efforts.

d. Friendly Forces.

1. Higher Headquarters: A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF.

2. Mission. A Company conducts reconnaissance operations to locate and assess enemy forces in AO COTTO.

3. Commander's Intent. Gather intelligence on enemy positions, strength, and disposition to enable follow-on operations and prevent enemy freedom of action.

e. Civil Considerations. Local civilians may be present in the area. Reconnaissance must minimize detection and avoid contact with non-combatants to maintain operational security and good relations.

f. Attachments and Detachments. None.

**2. MISSION.**

1st Platoon conducts an area reconnaissance of AO COTTO NLT ____ to locate enemy positions, assess enemy strength and disposition, and identify key terrain features to enable follow-on operations.

**3. EXECUTION.**

a. Concept of Operations. 1st Platoon establishes an ORP, then conducts area reconnaissance using zone or area reconnaissance techniques. Squads are assigned sectors or zones to reconnoiter, maintaining security and avoiding detection. The platoon collects intelligence on enemy positions, activities, and terrain, then consolidates findings and reports to higher headquarters. The platoon maintains the capability to break contact and withdraw if compromised.

b. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver.

- Squads move from the ORP to assigned reconnaissance sectors using covered and concealed routes.
- Reconnaissance conducted using appropriate techniques (zone recon, area recon, or route recon as assigned).
- Elements maintain security, use noise and light discipline, and avoid detection.
- Upon completion or if compromised, squads return to ORP for consolidation and reporting.

c. Scheme of Fires. Fires are limited to self-defense only. Avoid engagement unless necessary to break contact. Priority of fires to squad in contact if engagement occurs.

d. Tasks to Subordinate Units:

1. 1st Squad:

   **TASK:** Conduct reconnaissance of the northern sector of AO COTTO, focusing on the area north of the creek line and east of MP 0620 1540, to locate enemy positions and assess enemy activity.

   **PURPOSE:** Gather intelligence on enemy positions and activities in the northern portion of the area of operations.

2. 2nd Squad:

   **TASK:** Conduct reconnaissance of the southern sector of AO COTTO, focusing on the area south of the creek line and around MP 0620 1540, to locate enemy positions and assess enemy activity.

   **PURPOSE:** Gather intelligence on enemy positions and activities in the southern portion of the area of operations, including the suspected enemy position.

3. 3rd Squad:

   **TASK:** Establish and secure the ORP, maintain security during reconnaissance operations, and be prepared to support other squads if contact is made or if extraction is required.

   **PURPOSE:** Provide a secure base for reconnaissance operations and ensure platoon security during the mission.

e. Coordinating Instructions:

5. This OPORD is effective immediately upon distribution.

6. Counter-UAS (C-UAS) Measures:
- All units must account for the possibility of enemy UAS employment during all phases of the operation.
- Assign observation and reporting responsibilities for UAS threats within each squad.
- Use terrain, camouflage, and movement discipline to reduce detection by enemy drones.
- Remain aware of the evolving capabilities of enemy and irregular forces, including electronic warfare and commercial drone use.
- Consider timing of reconnaissance to minimize UAS detection risk.
