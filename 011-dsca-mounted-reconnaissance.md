**OPERATIONAL PLAN / ORDER #011 / CODE NAME: "HURRICANE DELTA ROUTE RECON"**

> **CADRE / OPFOR NOTES**
>
> **Complexity:** Moderate | **Recommended Phase:** WALK (Blocks 2-3), RUN (Day Iterations)
>
> **Mission Summary:** 1st Platoon is tasked to conduct mounted area reconnaissance of designated routes and critical infrastructure in Bay County to assess damage, identify hazards, and report conditions to enable follow-on relief operations.
>
> **Destination:** Bay County, FL. Reconnaissance sectors include primary routes, critical infrastructure, and potential POD sites.
>
> **Actions on Objective:** Platoon will conduct systematic reconnaissance of assigned sectors, assess and document road conditions, bridge status, debris fields, flooding, and infrastructure damage. Platoon will identify potential POD sites and staging areas for follow-on forces.
>
> **Training Focus:** This OPORD emphasizes reconnaissance fundamentals in a DSCA context. Candidates focus on systematic observation, accurate reporting, route assessment, and documentation. Tests ability to gather and communicate critical information for planning purposes.
>
> **Evaluation Timeline:** For evaluated iterations, candidates will receive this OPORD and have 75 minutes to complete TLP Steps 1-8 before SP. Execution window is 90 minutes (simulated). AAR is 15 minutes.
>
> **OPFOR/Training Wrinkles:**
> - Power outages causing traffic signals to be inoperable (test navigation and intersection discipline).
> - Fuel stations empty or inoperable (test fuel planning and range management).
> - Blocked routes requiring immediate rerouting and alternate route assessment.
> - Damaged bridges requiring trafficability assessment (GO/NO-GO decisions).
> - Downed power lines creating hazards (reporting and avoidance).
> - Flooded roads requiring depth assessment before crossing.
> - Communication dead zones requiring alternate reporting methods.
> - Civilians approaching vehicles requesting assistance or information.
> - Local officials requesting immediate reconnaissance of specific area.
> - Desperate civilians blocking route requesting immediate help (ROE/priorities decision).
> - Potential looting or criminal activity observed (reporting procedures).
> - Media presence requesting information or interviews.
>
> **NOTE:** This is a DSCA operation. There is no enemy threat, but security awareness remains important. Reconnaissance focuses on infrastructure and conditions, not enemy positions.

## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Bay County, Florida, and surrounding areas affected by Hurricane DELTA. The hurricane made landfall 48 hours ago as a Category 3 storm, causing widespread damage. Higher headquarters requires detailed reconnaissance of routes, infrastructure, and potential staging areas to plan relief operations.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Bay County features coastal and inland terrain including urban areas (Panama City, Lynn Haven), suburban development, pine forests, and waterways. Hurricane damage includes debris fields, flooding, structural damage, and infrastructure failures. Roads may be blocked, bridges may be damaged, and low-lying areas may be flooded.

   - **Key Terrain:** US-231 corridor (primary north-south route), US-98 (coastal route), SR-77 (alternate route), Panama City downtown area, Bay County Emergency Operations Center, hospitals, schools (potential shelters/POD sites).

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear skies, temperature 75-85°F, humidity 70-80%. Standing water in low-lying areas. Debris throughout affected areas.

### c. Civil Considerations
Hurricane DELTA caused catastrophic damage to Bay County. The civilian population is in crisis: many are displaced, without power, water, or communications. Civilians will approach military vehicles seeking help, information, or supplies. Emergency services are overwhelmed. Other agencies (FEMA, Red Cross, local government) are conducting concurrent operations.

**1. Population.** Approximately 180,000 residents in Bay County. Many sheltering in place without power or water. Some areas inaccessible.

**2. Infrastructure.** Power grid severely damaged (estimated 90% without power). Cell towers damaged. Water treatment affected. Gas stations closed. Traffic signals non-operational.

**3. Hazards.** Downed power lines (assume energized until confirmed otherwise). Structural damage (buildings may be unstable). Flooding. Debris (including hazardous materials). Desperate or distressed civilians.

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** A Co. 4th BN – 211th INF, supporting the Florida National Guard Joint Task Force – Hurricane DELTA.

**2. Mission.** A Company conducts reconnaissance and security operations in Bay County to enable follow-on relief operations.

**3. Commander's Intent.** Conduct thorough reconnaissance to provide accurate, timely information for planning relief operations. Identify routes, hazards, and potential staging/distribution sites. Assist civilians when feasible without compromising the reconnaissance mission.

### e. Attachments and Detachments
None.

## 2. MISSION

1st Platoon conducts mounted area reconnaissance of designated sectors in Bay County NLT ____ to assess damage, identify hazards, and report conditions to enable follow-on relief operations in support of Hurricane DELTA response.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**1. Commander's Intent.** 1st Platoon conducts thorough reconnaissance of assigned sectors to provide accurate, timely information enabling effective planning and execution of relief operations.

**2. Purpose.** The purpose of this operation is to gather critical information on route conditions, infrastructure status, and potential distribution sites to enable follow-on humanitarian assistance operations.

**3. End State.** Assigned sectors are reconnoitered, route conditions and infrastructure status are assessed and reported, potential POD sites are identified, and the platoon is prepared for follow-on operations.

### b. Concept of Operations
1st Platoon conducts mounted area reconnaissance of assigned sectors in Bay County. Vehicles are equipped with cameras/documentation equipment and GPS. Each squad is assigned a sector to reconnoiter systematically. Squads assess route trafficability, bridge conditions, debris fields, flooding, infrastructure damage, and civilian conditions. Squads identify and assess potential POD sites and staging areas. All findings are documented and reported. The platoon maintains communication and accountability throughout operations. Upon completion, the platoon consolidates at the designated rally point and provides a comprehensive report to higher headquarters.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Platoon moves from Camp Blanding to Bay County via primary route (OPORD 010 route).
- Upon arrival at Bay County RP, squads disperse to assigned reconnaissance sectors.
- Each squad conducts systematic reconnaissance of assigned routes and areas.
- Squads report significant findings immediately; consolidate reports at designated times.
- Upon completion, squads return to rally point for consolidation and reporting.

### d. Scheme of Fires
Not applicable (DSCA operation).
