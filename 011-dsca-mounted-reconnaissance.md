## 1. SITUATION

### a. Area of Interest
Bay County, Florida, and surrounding areas. Hurricane DELTA made landfall 48 hours ago as a Category 3 storm. Higher headquarters requires detailed reconnaissance of routes, infrastructure, and potential staging areas to plan relief operations.

### b. Area of Operations

**1. Terrain.** Bay County features coastal and inland terrain including urban areas (Panama City, Lynn Haven), suburban development, and waterways. Hurricane damage includes debris fields, flooding, structural damage, and infrastructure failures. Roads may be blocked, bridges damaged, and low-lying areas flooded.

   - **Key Terrain:**
     - US-231 corridor (primary north-south supply route)
     - US-98 (coastal route)
     - SR-77 (alternate inland route)
     - Panama City downtown area
     - Bay County EOC
     - Bay Medical Center
     - Schools and churches (potential POD sites)

**2. Weather.** Post-hurricane conditions: Clear skies, temperature 75-85°F, humidity 70-80%. Standing water in low-lying areas. Debris throughout.

### c. Civil Considerations
Hurricane DELTA caused catastrophic damage. Civilian population is in crisis—many without power, water, or communications. Civilians will approach military vehicles seeking help or information. Emergency services are overwhelmed. Other agencies (FEMA, Red Cross) are conducting concurrent operations.

**1. Infrastructure Status:**
   - Power: 90% without power in Bay County
   - Communications: Cell service severely degraded
   - Water: Treatment facilities affected
   - Fuel: Most stations closed
   - Traffic signals: Non-operational

**2. Hazards:**
   - Downed power lines (assume energized)
   - Structural damage (buildings may be unstable)
   - Flooding
   - Debris (including hazardous materials)

### d. Friendly Forces

**1. Higher Headquarters:** 4th BN, 211th INF, supporting Florida National Guard Joint Task Force – Hurricane DELTA.

**2. Battalion Mission.** 4th Battalion conducts reconnaissance and security operations in Bay County to enable follow-on relief operations.

**3. Battalion Commander's Intent.** Conduct thorough reconnaissance to provide accurate, timely information for planning relief operations. Identify safe routes, hazards, and suitable sites for distribution operations. Assist civilians when feasible without compromising the reconnaissance mission.

**4. Adjacent Units:**
   - B Company: Conducting reconnaissance in Gulf County
   - C Company: Route clearance operations on US-98

### e. Attachments and Detachments
None.

---

## 2. MISSION

A Company conducts mounted area reconnaissance of designated sectors in Bay County NLT ____ to assess damage, identify hazards, and report conditions to enable follow-on relief operations in support of Hurricane DELTA response.

---

## 3. EXECUTION

### a. Commander's Intent

**1. Commander's Intent.** A Company conducts thorough reconnaissance of assigned sectors to provide accurate, timely information that enables effective relief operations. We will document conditions systematically and report findings promptly.

**2. Purpose.** Gather critical information on route conditions, infrastructure status, and potential distribution sites to enable humanitarian assistance operations.

**3. End State.** All assigned sectors reconnoitered, route conditions and infrastructure status reported, potential POD sites identified, company consolidated and prepared for follow-on operations.

**4. Key Tasks:**
   - Reconnoiter assigned sectors systematically
   - Assess route trafficability for supply convoys
   - Identify and report hazards
   - Locate and assess potential POD sites
   - Document findings with photos/video

### b. Concept of Operations
A Company conducts mounted reconnaissance of Bay County in four sectors. 1st Platoon reconnoiters Sectors 1 and 2 (US-231 corridor and Panama City urban area). 2nd Platoon reconnoiters Sectors 3 and 4 (SR-77 and western Bay County). 3rd Platoon maintains security of the staging area and serves as QRF. Platoons conduct systematic reconnaissance, document findings, and report to the Company TOC. Upon completion, platoons consolidate at the staging area for debrief.

### c. Scheme of Movement and Maneuver
- Platoons depart staging area and move to assigned sectors
- Squads may operate independently within sectors (PL discretion based on communications)
- Systematic reconnaissance of routes, infrastructure, and potential sites
- Consolidation at staging area upon completion or on order

### d. Scheme of Fires
Not applicable (DSCA operation).
