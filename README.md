# OCS Operations Orders

All Operations Orders should be written in GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) format. Changes to the Markdown (.md) files will generate new PDFs during the next deployment.

## Available Orders

Each tactical OPORD is available in two versions. Use **Detailed** for early iterations and candidates who need scaffolding. Use **Mission Command** for later iterations where squad leaders must develop their own schemes of maneuver.

- **Mission Command:** Tasks state outcomes and general areas — squad leaders develop their own positioning, routes, and fire plans.
- **Detailed:** Tasks include specific grids, movement directions, team-level assignments, and sequencing — cadre walks candidates through a school solution.

### DSCA Operations (Hurricane Response)

These OPORDs support TLP planning exercises focused on Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations. Set during a fictional Hurricane DELTA response in Florida, they introduce candidates to real-world National Guard domestic operations including convoy movements, reconnaissance, and humanitarian assistance. These are planning exercises only — candidates develop orders but do not execute.

## FLX — Operation SPRING STRIKE

- [FLX Operation Orders](FLX/) — Class 065 Culmination FLX, 05–08 March 2026, CBJTC Starke FL

## FLX Variation System

To keep iterations fresh during multiple FLX runs, use the inject card system:

- [Inject Cards User Guide](inject-cards-guide.md) - How to use the inject card system
- [Situation Update Cards](inject-cards-situation-updates.md) - Intelligence and situation updates (10 cards)
- [Enemy Behavior Cards](inject-cards-enemy-behavior.md) - REAPER action variations (10 cards)
- [Friendly Force Status Cards](inject-cards-friendly-force-status.md) - Friendly unit condition changes (10 cards)
- [Weather/Terrain Cards](inject-cards-weather-terrain.md) - Environmental condition variations (10 cards)
- [Civilian Scenario Cards](inject-cards-civilian-scenarios.md) - ROE and decision-making challenges (10 cards)
- [Timeline Pressure Cards](inject-cards-timeline-pressure.md) - Time constraint variations (10 cards)

**Quick Start:** Select 1-3 inject cards from different categories per iteration to create unique scenarios without needing new OPORDs.
