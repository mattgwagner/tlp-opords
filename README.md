# ARNG Tactical Training Library

A collection of operations orders, training packages, and reference materials for Army National Guard tactical training. Originally developed for OCS field training exercises at Camp Blanding, these materials support squad and platoon-level TLP training, STX evaluation lanes, and company-level staff exercises.

All content is written in GitHub Flavored Markdown and automatically converted to HTML on deployment.

## STX Evaluation Lanes

Each tactical OPORD is available in two versions. Use **Detailed** for early iterations and leaders who need scaffolding. Use **Mission Command** for later iterations where squad leaders must develop their own schemes of maneuver.

- **Mission Command:** Tasks state outcomes and general areas — squad leaders develop their own positioning, routes, and fire plans.
- **Detailed:** Tasks include specific grids, movement directions, team-level assignments, and sequencing — cadre walks leaders through a school solution.

### DSCA Operations (Hurricane Response)

These OPORDs support TLP planning exercises focused on Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations. Set during a fictional Hurricane DELTA response in Florida, they introduce leaders to real-world National Guard domestic operations including convoy movements, reconnaissance, and humanitarian assistance. These are planning exercises only — leaders develop orders but do not execute.

## Inject Card System

To keep iterations fresh during multiple training runs, use the inject card system:

- [Inject Cards User Guide](inject-cards-guide.html) - How to use the inject card system
- [Situation Update Cards](inject-cards-situation-updates.html) - Intelligence and situation updates (10 cards)
- [Enemy Behavior Cards](inject-cards-enemy-behavior.html) - REAPER action variations (10 cards)
- [Friendly Force Status Cards](inject-cards-friendly-force-status.html) - Friendly unit condition changes (10 cards)
- [Weather/Terrain Cards](inject-cards-weather-terrain.html) - Environmental condition variations (10 cards)
- [Civilian Scenario Cards](inject-cards-civilian-scenarios.html) - ROE and decision-making challenges (10 cards)
- [Timeline Pressure Cards](inject-cards-timeline-pressure.html) - Time constraint variations (10 cards)

**Quick Start:** Select 1-3 inject cards from different categories per iteration to create unique scenarios without needing new OPORDs.

## Field Leadership Exercise (FLX)

The FLX is a multi-day company-level staff exercise where candidates plan and execute a series of tactical operations under a single operational framework. FLX materials — including the cadre brief, company staff guide, and sequential operation orders — are available to cadre separately.
