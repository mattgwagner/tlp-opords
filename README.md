# OCS Operations Orders

All Operations Orders should be written in GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) format. Changes to the Markdown (.md) files will generate new PDFs during the next deployment.

## Templates and References

- [OPORD Blank Template](opord-blank-template.html) - A fill-in-the-blank template with quick references designed to help build operations orders in an expedited manner.
- [TAC's Tactical Quick Reference](tac-quick-reference.html) - A comprehensive reference guide for movement formations, movement techniques, danger area crossings, battle drills, and actions on the objective. Designed to help TACs evaluate OCS candidates during field training exercises.
- [Patrol Base Operations](patrol-base-ops.html) - A crawl phase training package covering patrol base operations, including cadre refresher material, inspection checklists, scenario injects, and implementation notes. Reference for establishing and operating patrol bases per ATP 3-21.8.
- [Troop Leading Procedures](POI/Slides-RevealJS.html) - Interactive instructional slides covering the 8-step TLP framework, mission analysis (METT-TC), terrain analysis (OAKOC), and COA development (AGADAP) per ATP 3-21.8 and FM 6-0.
- [TLP Training Package](tlp-training-package.md) - Complete Crawl-Walk-Run training package for Troop Leading Procedures. Includes 4-hour CRAWL phase (conceptual), 15-hour WALK phase (guided practice), and 48-hour RUN phase (FTX evaluation). References CMP, ISAP, and OCSOP standards with FLER evaluation criteria.

## FLX Variation System

To keep iterations fresh during multiple FLX runs, use the inject card system:

- [Inject Cards User Guide](inject-cards-guide.md) - How to use the inject card system
- [Situation Update Cards](inject-cards-situation-updates.md) - Intelligence and situation updates (10 cards)
- [Enemy Behavior Cards](inject-cards-enemy-behavior.md) - REAPER action variations (10 cards)
- [Friendly Force Status Cards](inject-cards-friendly-force-status.md) - Friendly unit condition changes (10 cards)
- [Weather/Terrain Cards](inject-cards-weather-terrain.md) - Environmental condition variations (10 cards)
- [Civilian Scenario Cards](inject-cards-civilian-scenarios.md) - ROE and decision-making challenges (10 cards)
- [Timeline Pressure Cards](inject-cards-timeline-pressure.md) - Time constraint variations (10 cards)

**Quick Start:** Select 1-3 inject cards from different categories per iteration to create unique scenarios without needing new OPORDs.
