# OCS Operations Orders

All Operations Orders should be written in GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) format. Changes to the Markdown (.md) files will generate new PDFs during the next deployment.

## OPORD Detail Levels

Each tactical OPORD is available in two versions to support the Crawl-Walk-Run training progression. Use the **Detailed** version for early iterations and candidates who need scaffolding. Use the **Mission Command** version for later iterations where squad leaders must develop their own schemes of maneuver.

| # | Mission | Complexity | Mission Command | Detailed |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| 001 | Ambush at Crossroads | Moderate | [Mission Command](001-ambush.md) | [Detailed](001-ambush-detailed.md) |
| 002 | Movement to Contact | Moderate | [Mission Command](002-movement-to-contact.md) | [Detailed](002-movement-to-contact-detailed.md) |
| 003 | Raid on Bunker | Higher | [Mission Command](003-raid-a-bunker.md) | [Detailed](003-raid-a-bunker-detailed.md) |
| 004 | Clear Dismount City | Highest | [Mission Command](004-clear-dismount-city.md) | [Detailed](004-clear-dismount-city-detailed.md) |
| 005 | Area/Zone Reconnaissance | Lower | [Mission Command](005-area-zone-reconnaissance.md) | [Detailed](005-area-zone-reconnaissance-detailed.md) |
| 006 | Base Defense | Moderate | [Mission Command](006-base-defense.md) | [Detailed](006-base-defense-detailed.md) |
| 007 | Forward Passage of Lines | Highest | [Mission Command](007-forward-passage-of-lines.md) | [Detailed](007-forward-passage-of-lines-detailed.md) |
| 008 | Patrol Base Operations | Moderate | [Mission Command](008-patrol-base-operations.md) | [Detailed](008-patrol-base-operations-detailed.md) |
| 009 | Tactical Road March | Lower | [Mission Command](009-tactical-road-march.md) | [Detailed](009-tactical-road-march-detailed.md) |
| 013 | Establish Combat Outpost | Highest | [Mission Command](013-establish-cop.md) | [Detailed](013-establish-cop-detailed.md) |
| 014 | Deliberate Attack (CRAWL) | Moderate | [Mission Command](014-deliberate-attack.md) | [Detailed](014-deliberate-attack-detailed.md) |

**Mission Command version:** Tasks state outcomes and general areas — squad leaders must develop their own positioning, routes, and fire plans.

**Detailed version:** Tasks include specific grids, movement directions, team-level assignments, and sequencing — cadre walks candidates through a school solution.

DSCA OPORDs (010-012) are planning exercises only and do not use the tiered system.

## Available Orders

### CRAWL Phase Training
- [Deliberate Attack (TLP Practical Exercise)](014-deliberate-attack.md) - Simplified platoon deliberate attack with a step-by-step TLP walkthrough annotated with references to the [TLP Instructional Slides](POI/Slides-RevealJS.html). Designed for crawl-phase classroom instruction where the TAC briefs the order, then walks candidates through each TLP step as applied to the mission.

### Evaluated Missions (Wooded Terrain)
- [Ambush at Crossroads](001-ambush.md) - [PDF](001-ambush.pdf)
- [Movement to Contact](002-movement-to-contact.md) - [PDF](002-movement-to-contact.pdf)
- [Raid on Bunker](003-raid-a-bunker.md) - [PDF](003-raid-a-bunker.pdf)
- [Area/Zone Reconnaissance](005-area-zone-reconnaissance.md) - [PDF](005-area-zone-reconnaissance.pdf)
- [Tactical Road March](009-tactical-road-march.md) - [PDF](009-tactical-road-march.pdf)

### MOUT Training Scenarios
- [Clear Dismount City](004-clear-dismount-city.md) - [PDF](004-clear-dismount-city.pdf)
- [Base Defense](006-base-defense.md) - [PDF](006-base-defense.pdf)
- [Forward Passage of Lines](007-forward-passage-of-lines.md) - [PDF](007-forward-passage-of-lines.pdf)
- [Establish Combat Outpost](013-establish-cop.md) - Multi-phase clearing, occupation, and CP establishment. Designed as the opening operation for a capstone LFX — the COP becomes the base of operations for follow-on missions.

### Static Operations
- [Patrol Base Operations](008-patrol-base-operations.md) - [PDF](008-patrol-base-operations.pdf)

### DSCA Operations (Hurricane Response)

These OPORDs support TLP planning exercises focused on Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations. Set during a fictional Hurricane DELTA response in Florida, they introduce candidates to real-world National Guard domestic operations including convoy movements, reconnaissance, and humanitarian assistance. These are planning exercises only—candidates develop orders but do not execute.

- [Hurricane Relief Convoy](010-dsca-convoy-operations.md) - [PDF](010-dsca-convoy-operations.pdf)
- [Mounted Area Reconnaissance](011-dsca-mounted-reconnaissance.md) - [PDF](011-dsca-mounted-reconnaissance.pdf)
- [Point of Distribution Operations](012-dsca-point-of-distribution.md) - [PDF](012-dsca-point-of-distribution.pdf)

## FLX Variation System

To keep iterations fresh during multiple FLX runs, use the inject card system:

- [Inject Cards User Guide](inject-cards-guide.md) - How to use the inject card system
- [Situation Update Cards](inject-cards-situation-updates.md) - Intelligence and situation updates (10 cards)
- [Enemy Behavior Cards](inject-cards-enemy-behavior.md) - REAPER action variations (10 cards)
- [Friendly Force Status Cards](inject-cards-friendly-force-status.md) - Friendly unit condition changes (10 cards)
- [Weather/Terrain Cards](inject-cards-weather-terrain.md) - Environmental condition variations (10 cards)
- [Civilian Scenario Cards](inject-cards-civilian-scenarios.md) - ROE and decision-making challenges (10 cards)
- [Timeline Pressure Cards](inject-cards-timeline-pressure.md) - Time constraint variations (10 cards)

**Quick Start:** Select 1-3 inject cards from different categories per iteration to create unique scenarios without needing new OPORDs.
